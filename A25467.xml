            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I'll not mention the Caſes unavoydably (ſome by Sickneſs, ſome otherwiſe) omitted; and for thoſe here, ſhould I place them in this Preface, as I intended them in the Book, tbô it might ſomewhat rectifie their Order, 'twould not add to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore take them as they are, and the Bleſſing of God go along with them; and certainly 'twill, [as to you] if you are willing it ſhould, pray try elſe. <hi>(1)</hi> We are ſurrounded with Vanities, let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> your Converſation be in Heaven, you'l be above them.

               <hi>Reproach hath broken my Heart:</hi> matter of Honour and Reputation is a tender point, not any, of what rank ſoever, but deeply reſent the being ſlighted.</p>
            <p>But for Honour, when we conſider how <hi>hazardous</hi> it is to get, (thô all are clambering, few reach it;) conſider further, when 'tis got, 'tis <hi>ſlippery</hi> to hold, (others envy and their own fear, diſtract 'em;) and then if you adde the <hi>falling</hi> from it, (that's worſe than if they never had it;) but there's worſe than all this, the inſuperable temptation to pride, oppreſſion, and impenitency, all which nothing but Grace can prevent or cure.

            <p>But how do theſe in running from one Vanity, fall into another! They debaſe the humane Nature, and the reaſonable Soul, while they induſtriouſly conceal themſelves from being ſerviceable; they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a civil Self-excommunication, while they ſhut out themſelves from thoſe Employments wherein they might be uſeful.

            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> (and who miſtruſts ſuch a <hi>but</hi> here) the wiſer men are, the more they are exempted from the ordinary Comforts of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; they meet with but few, and thoſe but ſeldom, that they can converſe with, to any Satisfaction; the more Learning they have, the more Senſe of, and Sorrow for their Ignorance.<note n="b" place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>In much Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is much Grief, and he that increaſeth Knowledge increaſeth Sorrow.</hi> Hence it is they affect an <hi>uncomfortable</hi> Solitude, that they are fain to <hi>force</hi> themſelves into a ſociable complyance, where they ſeldom meet with any thing but what they <hi>ſlight</hi> or <hi>pity;</hi> they are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the objects of their <hi>own</hi> grief, and of <hi>others</hi> envy.

They don't impair their health by ſtudy, nor perplex themſelves with great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. What can be more deſired to make them happy? Happineſs (as it were) drops into their mouth unawares; for when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Condition with others, they find it more eligible, thô they did nothing to make it ſo. But alas! what uſe do theſe make of their Souls? A lazy neglect of <hi>improving</hi> of parts, and of <hi>getting</hi> of <hi>learning,</hi> who is able to expreſs the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſchief</hi> of it?

            <p>But alas! <hi>the Church of Chriſtian as little bear continual Proſperity, as long Adverſity:</hi> a Calm is ſometimes as dangerous as a Storm.

            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Serious Godlineſs</hi> is the beſt <hi>Preſervative</hi> againſt <hi>Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on Proſperity. 'Tis Grace in the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> and <hi>Growth,</hi> that powerfully <hi>enables,</hi> and neceſſarily <hi>provokes</hi> to improve the Churches Peace to all Spiritual advantages. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was never in ſuch a flouriſhing condition as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign; and is it not well worthy our obſervation, that the Poſterity of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who became Proſelytes to the Jewiſh Religion, were ſeveral Ages after his death, doubly recorded by<note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 7.57.60.</note> the Spirit of God, above the Proſelytes of former Ages?</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Serious Godlineſs</hi> that keeps them <hi>humble,</hi> and always upon their Watch againſt flattering Temptations; that keeps them <hi>low</hi> in their own eyes, and from deſpiſing others: and what on this ſide great Grace, could make <hi>David,</hi> who had a<note n="b" place="margin">1 Chron. 22.14.</note> greater Summe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money than ever <hi>any had</hi> in the World, either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>ſince,</hi> preferr that <hi>little</hi> of Scripture that was penn'd in his time, before an innumerable Treaſure<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 119.72.</note>?

            <p>What then! <hi>Is a State of Perſecution more Eligible?</hi> Before I dare ſpeak a word to this, I muſt premiſe this Caution: Let not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors take encouragement to be more outragious in their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and then ſcornfully tell you, this is good for 'em, their Paſtors tell 'em 'tis ſometimes better for 'em than Peace. This is like <hi>Julian,</hi> who in every thing he did, with a <hi>deep</hi> Reach, and <hi>greater</hi> Malice than former Emperors, to undermine and <hi>worm</hi> out the Chriſtian Religion, he ſtill twitted the Chriſtians with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or promiſe of Chriſt to his Diſciples about Perſecution, jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly telling 'em 'twas for their good. Let ſuch Perſons know, and O that they would conſider, that though God hath, and doth, and will bring good out of evil, and over-rule the fury of men for the good of his People; yet this is not the <hi>leaſt</hi> excuſe for their Sin,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42587:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> nor can it be pleaded to <hi>abate</hi> their Puniſhment. To give you an Inſtance, I can't give a greater, and I need give no more: The <hi>Jews Perſecution</hi> of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>'twas predetermin'd of God,</hi> and eventually <hi>proved the greateſt good to man,</hi> yet no thank to them, nor <hi>alleviation</hi> of their guilt:<note n="f" place="margin">Acts 2.23.</note>

               <hi>They have perſecuted us, and they pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to ſpeak unto the Gentiles that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſin alway; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> And how heavy doth that Doom ly upon them to this day! I'le add no more to this Caution, but a <hi>Requeſt</hi> to Perſecutors, to read, and think, and pray over the Second Pſalm.</p>
            <p>This premiſed, much may be ſaid of the good which God doth in, and for, and by his Children, by bringing them into, his preſence in, and deliverance out of, Perſecution; how God <hi>increaſeth</hi> their Graces, <hi>heightens</hi> their Comforts, <hi>multiplyes</hi> their Experiences, <hi>beyond</hi> what he doth any <hi>other</hi> time of their lives. I remember <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a Paſſage, (though being ſeparated from my Books, I cannot name where,) That <hi>if a Perſon ſuffer death for Chriſt before Converſion, his Martyrdom ſhall be to him inſtead of Regeneration:</hi> But if you will not receive his Teſtimony about the <hi>firſt</hi> Grace, I am ſure you'l not deny my next about the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of Grace<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 5.8.</note>. Our great <hi>Exemplar,</hi> thô he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> yet as he was <hi>the Son of man, he experimentally learned Obedience by the things which he ſuffered:</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt tells us<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2.10.</note>, <hi>It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> 'Tis <hi>hard</hi> to ſay what <hi>kind</hi> of Perfection Chriſt had by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but 'tis <hi>eaſie</hi> to obſerve how Sufferings tend to the <hi>Perfecting</hi> of Chriſtians; they <hi>force</hi> them to a more <hi>ſevere</hi> examination of Heart and Life, and to a more <hi>thorow</hi> Repentance of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't God to lay them under Sufferings: then their <hi>Prayers</hi> are more <hi>fervent,</hi> and their whole Converſation <hi>more</hi> regular than at other times: ſo that I know not whether as well the former, as the latter part of that paſſage may not be a gracious Promiſe.

            <p>Three things only in the words call for a little Explication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>Hope?</hi> Either <hi>hope</hi> here is the ſame that Faith is, (and ſo it is in divers other places) and then to give a reaſon of their Hope,<note place="margin">Calvin. in loc. Grot.</note> is to make a Confeſſion of their Faith; ſo ſome take it. Or it may be taken Synechdochically, for the whole of their Religion, as others; And indeed the hope of a Chriſtian being one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Acts of Religion, and ſeeming withall to the profane and ignorant World, one of the moſt ſtrange things in it, and which was moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd againſt, and laugh'd at<note n="†" place="margin">Act. 17.18.32.</note>, (for men to expect a Life after death, a glorious Reſurrection after a diſhonourable lying in the grave, and to renounce all Worldly enjoyments, and expoſe themſelves to the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſufferings meerly in hope of ſomething they did not ſee, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to enjoy till after they were dead,) it might well be put for the whole of Religion, as being ſo remarkable in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is meant by this <hi>Anſwer</hi> they were to give? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is elſewhere frequently rendred by <hi>defence, Act.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7.17. it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>anſwer,</hi> as here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.3. you may call it an Apologetical, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive anſwer, as relating to their Enemies accuſation, or charge againſt them, or Examination of them; they might look upon the Religion of Chriſtians as an unreaſonable thing, and therefore require a reaſon of their Faith and Practice, which if they ſhould, the Apoſtle would have them ready to make their defence, and ſhew how good grounds they had for both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How they were to <hi>be always ready to give an anſwer.</hi> It doth not imply that they were bound to do it to every Caviller, or trifler, but when the Glory of God and the Honour of the Goſpel required it, and when their ſilence might be injurious to the Truth, to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or their Brethrens Souls; and ſo Chriſtian Prudence ought to judge of the ſeaſonableneſs of their making their defence; they were not bound always actually to do it, but to be always actually ready, whenever God in his Providence ſhould call them to it.</p>
            <p>Now from what our Apoſtle enjoyns theſe Saints to be always ready to do, I inferr what all true Saints may be able to do, at leaſt what the nature of the thing is capable of, and ſo the doctrinal Inference I deduce from the words, is this:
<q>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42587:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>That true Chriſtians may give a ſatisfactory account of their Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that it is ſomething both real and reaſonable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> not Folly nor Fancy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this Truth, two things are to be done:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew, that true Believers may give an account of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they profeſs according to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall give Directions in anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>How a Believer may be able to experience in himſelf, and evidence to others, that his Religion</hi> (that powerful Godlineſs in the Practice whereof he lives) <hi>is more than a Fancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>That true Believers may give a good account of the Religion they profeſs.</hi> Moſt that the carnal World is wont to object againſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Religion in the Saints, may be reduced to three heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt their <hi>Faith</hi> (in which I include their Hope as of kin to it and the Fruit of it) it is objected that it is but a <hi>fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt their <hi>Obedience</hi> and cloſe walking with God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in Duty, which is the fruit of their Faith, that it is but the <hi>effect of Fancy,</hi> and ſo no better than <hi>folly,</hi> an unreaſonable and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs niceneſs and ſcrupuloſity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againſt their <hi>Comforts,</hi> and ſpiritual Enjoyments, that they can be no better than their Faith and Obedience from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and are no more than meer <hi>Imaginations and deluſive Conceits.</hi> In anſwer to each of theſe, I ſhall (I hope) evidence the contrary to be moſt true.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Faith of a true Believer is ſomething reall, and not a Fancy.</hi> By the Faith of a Saint I underſtand only that lively, and effectual Faith which is the Inſtrument, or Means (call it as you pleaſe) not only of a Saints Juſtification<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note>, but Sanctification<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 15.9.</note>, that which is called <hi>precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Tit. 1:1. as being peculiar to them, and the effect of their Election<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 13.48.</note>, that Faith, in a word, which is an apprehending Chriſt as <hi>the author of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note>, a believing <hi>the record God hath given of his Son,</hi> that <hi>eternal life is in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11. This Faith imports in it a reſpect to Chriſt as the Author of all other ſpiritual benefits antecedent to eternal Life; Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby a Believer is entitled to it, Sanctification whereby he is prepared for it, Conſolation by which he is encouraged in ſeeking it, and ſupported under the oppoſition, and difficulties he meets with in the way to it. But here I ſpeak of Faith eſpecially as reſpecting Eternal Salvation, which is one principal act of it, and which includes or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the other; and the rather becauſe the belief and expectation of Life, and Immortality after Death, is that which the unbelieving World looks upon as moſt ſtrange and unreaſonable, and takes all a Believer can ſay of his expecting future things in another World to be but ſtrong fancies of great Nothings. There is no act of Faith againſt which the Objections of carnal Reaſon are more uſually levelled than againſt this, and if the reality of a Chriſtians Faith appears in this, it can ſcarce be denyed in others. Now that this belief of Eternal Life
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42587:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> is ſomething real in a Saints Heart, and not meerly a Fancy in his Brains, might appear more than probable in that it hath been, and ſtill is to be found in thoſe who are leaſt fancyfull, men as ſerious, as judicious, as rational as any in the World; though <hi>not many wiſe men after the fleſh are called</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note>, yet ſome are: And it cannot reaſonably be imagined, that they who are confeſſedly Grave, and Prudent, and Diſcreet, and free from Conceits and Fancies in all other things, ſhould dote in thoſe only which are of the greateſt Concernment to them; eſpecially if we conſider that this Faith is ſtirring in them at ſuch times as men uſe to be leaſt given to Fancies, as on the moſt ſolemn Occaſions, under the greateſt Afflictions, and at the approach of the moſt terrible of all temporal evils, Death it ſelf. Men are moſt apt to be taken with Fancies, and Appearances when they are wholly at Eaſe, and fluſh in the World, and have hope, or ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of great things in it; then they are apt to fancy things according to their Appetites, and fondly to believe that that will be, which they deſire may be. But when Death draws nigh, they have nothing to encourage ſuch imaginations, and then uſually their Fancies vaniſh, they come to diſcover their folly, and deceitfulneſs; they judge quite contrary to what they did before; they then ſee thoſe things to be real which they counted but Fancies, and thoſe things to be but Fantaſtical which they had thought to be real. Now at ſuch a time as this, the Faith of a Saint (ſaving what deſertions or Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may occaſion in particular inſtances) is ordinarily more-ſtrong, and active; as his judgment of earthly things is more true when he is leaving them, ſo his apprehenſion of heavenly is more clear when he draws nigh to them; the approach of Death proves an enlivening to his Faith; he hath the faireſt view of the Crown of Glory when his Lord is about to ſet it on his head; the ſame thoughts indeed he then hath, which before he had, only more clear, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are at the laſt, there being leſs to interrupt, or diſcompoſe him. It were hard to ſay that all the Comforts and Joyes of dying Saints and Martyrs, have been meer Deluſions and Cheats, and yet ſo they muſt be, if the apprehenſions they have had of heavenly things were but Fancies and Ravings.</p>
            <p>But to paſs this by, it will ſufficiently evince the reality of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Faith, if we can make it appear, that the Object of it is real, the Ground of it certain, the Actings of it ſenſible to himſelf, and the Effects of it evident to others: This I ſhall endeavour to do.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As <hi>for the Object of a Believers Faith and Hope, that good which he believes ſhall be, and expects after this life,</hi> a ſtate of glory for <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men;</hi> He that ſhall deny that ſuch a thing is, muſt not own the Name of Chriſtian, when even the light of Nature will go ſo far toward the proving of it; for</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſhews us, <hi>that the Soul is immortal,</hi> as being of a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and independent on the Body in its moſt proper, and noble Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the actings of the Underſtanding and Will.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42587:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. <hi>That there is a reward after this life for them that do well,</hi> no leſs than on the contrary, Puniſhment for evil doers. This the generality of the Pagan World that knew not diſtinctly wherein that Reward did conſiſt, yet have granted the thing; and who is not inſtructed by his own Conſcience in the knowledge of it? <hi>The work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Heart</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note>, and the ſecret pleaſure, and ſatisfaction men take in their own Innocence, or good actions, proves a reward on the one hand, as well as the fears, and horrors which the Conſciences of the moſt ſlie and ſecret ſinners ſubject them to, ſpeak the puniſhment they expect on the other. And if theſe things were only impreſſions made upon mens Fancies in their tender years, it were ſtrange that all the Reaſon they grow up to exerciſe, and all the Art many obſtinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners make uſe of on purpoſe to obliterate them, and to impreſs the contrary upon their Minds, together with a thouſand other Species printed on their Imaginations by their Employments, their Pleaſures, and all the various Occaſions, and accidents of their Lives, ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to rid them of theſe ſo unpleaſing Sentiments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Something may be ſaid even from natural Reaſon to prove this <hi>reward to conſiſt in the enjoyment of God,</hi> and ſo not only to evince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of ſome Happineſs, but of this in particular, in the other life. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will ſcarce be denyed but that <hi>the ſoul of Man is capable of enjoying God as its Sovereign good,</hi> i. e. of moſt intenſely delighting, and entirely acquieſcing in him as a good ſuitable to the ſpiritual Nature, and ſufficient for the vaſt capacity of an immortal Soul. Some of the Heathen came near this, when they ſtated mans Happineſs as conſiſting in the Contemplation of the higheſt being. And indeed the very Nature, and Operations of the Soul, and its apprehending ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Objects, amounts to little leſs than a demonſtration of this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The enjoyment of God is the greateſt good any Creature can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</hi> God is in himſelf abſolutely the greateſt good, becauſe an infinite one, and comprehenſive of all Perfection; and there can be no greater good than to be poſſeſſed of him that is the greateſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The reward and happineſs of an holy Soul can be nothing leſs than the greateſt good,</hi> and therefore muſt needs be the enjoyment of God himſelf; this appears in that</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Leſs than the greateſt good cannot ſatisfie mans Soul,</hi> and then to be ſure cannot make it happy, when its happineſs conſiſts in its being fully ſatisfied. All the riches and pleaſures of this World, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Senſe can never be to the Soul inſtead of God, becauſe they are unſuitable to its nature which is ſpiritual, to its duration which is immortal, and to thoſe appetites God hath implanted in it. It's very capacity of enjoying God is attended with a ſecret Inclination to it, inſomuch that many times when a man may not have an explicit and diſtinct knowledge of the good he wants, yet being unſatisfied with what he hath (though never ſo great) he finds a want of ſomething elſe, and becauſe he wants it, he deſires it (though he know not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is) to make him happy.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42587:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. <hi>It is moſt congruous to the Wiſdom and goodneſs of God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the greateſt good to be the Happineſs of the nobleſt of his Creatures;</hi> not that they deſerve it, but becauſe he may be moſt glorified by it, and becauſe he hath given them a nature capable of it. As he ſuits the good of other Creatures to the capacities he hath given them, ſo he doth the good of man. None but Angels and men are capable of enjoying or actively glorifying him, and God having capacitated them for that, ſutes their good to their Capacity. It had not been agreeable to the Wiſdom of God for man to have had only ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour good in this Life aſſigned to him as his chief Happineſs, when he had made him capable of an higher. Thus much hath been ſaid (and more might) even from Reaſon it ſelf to prove the reality of thoſe things Believers look for in the other Life; How much might be ſaid from Scripture with reſpect to which only they are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith, but this I referre to the next head, <hi>the ground of a Chriſtian Faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That is certain.</hi> The ſame things ſometimes may both be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with a Divine Faith, and known too by natural Reaſon, but then the Medium whereby they are known, and the ground whereon they are believed are very different, the one is ſome rational argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other the Word of God. In the caſe before us, the being of Eternal Life (the preſent Object of Faith we ſpeak of) may be proved by reaſon, but then ſo far it is not the Object of Faith, but of Knowledge; but withall it may be proved by Scripture, and ſo it is the Object of Faith; and as ſuch I am now to ſpeak of it, and ſo to ſhew that the ground on which a Chriſtian believes Eternal Life, is moſt certain; and that is no other than <hi>the Word of God,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Promiſe of the Goſpel. The Scripture therefore is the ground of the Faith of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As it reveals it,</hi> for that it doth more fully, and clearly; though ſomething a man may know of future Happineſs by his natural light, (as before was ſaid) yet the faireſt, and moſt diſtinct notion he hath of it, is by Revelation in the Word, that tells us plainly what is that great good in which mans Happineſs conſiſts, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Seeing</hi> God <hi>as he is,</hi> and being <hi>like him. Life and Immortality</hi> are <hi>brought to light</hi> eſpecially <hi>by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. not only more diſtinctly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, than ever Nature could diſcern them, but than God himſelf had revealed them in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>it ſhews the way to it,</hi> the terms on which it is to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſets before us Eternal Life as in Chriſt; it not only tells us of the thing it ſelf, but ſhews how man, ſinfull man may attain to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; declares true Holineſs to be the way in which he is to walk, and Chriſt the Door by which he is to enter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As it ſecures it upon thoſe terms;</hi> for ſo it doth, it is the ſcope, and end of the Promiſe to ſecure Life and Glory to thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it upon the terms propounded; the Command directs in the way, and the Promiſe makes over and conveys the bleſſing. <hi>Believe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42587:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16.31. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To them that by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and Immortality, Eternal life</hi> is promiſed. Now the Word and Promiſe of God not only as revealing Life to us, and the way to it, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it, is the ground of our Faith, and Hope; though without the Word we might have ſome more general Knowledge of a State of Happineſs in the other World, yet without the Word we cannot know the way to it, nor ever attain to an Intereſt in it, nor have ſo full certainty of the very being of it as by the Word we have, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith being greater than that of any natural Knowledge whatever: we have no ground at all to believe we ſhall be ſaved but what the Promiſe affords us; And that is ſufficient ground to build our Faith upon, and a better we cannot have than the Word of him that is the Truth it ſelf, and ſo can neither deceive, nor be deceived, <hi>God that cannot lie hath promiſed Eternal life,</hi> Tit. 1.2. Upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and Veracity of that God in his holy Word the Faith of a Chriſtian reſts, and a ſurer Foundation for it cannot be imagined, and need not be deſired. As the certainty of any aſſent of the Mind to a truth depends upon the ſtrength, and firmneſs of the Reaſon, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which moves to, and procures that Aſſent, and is the Cauſe of it, ſo likewiſe the certainty of Faith proceeds from the goodneſs, and validity of the Authority which is the Motive to, and Reaſon of our believing, or (which is the ſame) the ground of it. If we believe a man, that belief is more or leſs certain according as the Perſon on whoſe Authority our belief is grounded, is more or leſs credible; and ſo when we believe God, our Faith is ſuch as its Foundation is, (the Effect imitates the Cauſe) the foundation of that Faith, Gods Veracity, is the beſt, and therefore the certainty of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith is the greateſt. If a man be ſure that what he believes is the Word of God, he may be ſure it is moſt true, and never will fail. And this no doubt may be ſufficient to ſatisfie a Believer in his own mind, or any one that receives the Scripture as the Word of God, concerning the reality of the Faith he profeſſeth, that the ground of it is ſo certain; but if he have to do with thoſe that believe not the Scripture, and ſo queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of his Faith, in that caſe he may have recourſe to all thoſe Arguments whereby we are wont to prove the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Word, and they all Confirm the Faith of a Chriſtian, and ſo the ſame account a Believer may give of the foundation of his Faith, as of the Divinity of the Scripture; if the Scripture be the Word of God, and that Word be true, his Faith built upon it is certain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Actings of a Christians Faith are perceivable by himſelf.</hi> Habits which cannot be diſcerned of themſelves when they lye ſtill, yet may be known by their actings, ſuch an Habit Faith is, which though it diſcover not it ſelf, or be not perceived when unactive, yet may be diſcern'd in its exerciſe: When a man actually believes, he may know he believes; reflect upon his own act, as well as when he hears, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42587:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſees, or walks, he may know he doth ſo, and is not deceived in it. Inward Senſe hath as much certainty in it as outward, and ſpiritual Senſe as natural; if a man therefore aſſent to the Truth of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he may know he aſſents to it, and if he accept of, and cloſe with the good Promiſed, he may know he doth ſo; though ſometimes Temptations may be ſo ſtrong, and the Actings of Faith ſo weak, and the Mind ſo clouded and diſtracted, that a man may hardly be able to paſs a right judgement on thoſe Acts, yet it is not always ſo, but other whiles, when the workings of Faith are more ſtrong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and a man more clear of temptations he may do it. In this therefore a man may give an account to himſelf of his Faith that it is reall, he may know that he believes the Promiſe of Eternal Life as really as he believes any ordinary Truth propoſed to him, and that his believing and reſting on Gods Word, is no more a Fancy, than his believing the word of a man: As for others with whom he hath to do, I know no reaſon why they ſhould not believe him when he ſays he believes Gods Promiſe, as well as when he ſays he believes their word, or why one ſhould be a Fancy any more than the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Effects of a Believers faith are evident to others</hi> in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well as to himſelf more fully: As he may perceive his Faith purifying his heart, taking it off from the World, drawing it near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, ſo others may ſee his Converſation ordered correſpondent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his believing; they may ſee him Shie of Sin, Diligent in Duty, Conſcientious in his Calling, Patient in Sufferings, Charitable to thoſe that Need him, Meek towards thoſe that Offend him, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, Spiritual, Savoury in his Converſe, Juſt and Righteous in his Dealings, and in a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Aſſurance in the Act, is nothing elſe but a Concluſion drawn by the practical Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a renewed Soul (through the aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) from two Premiſes, whereof the major is of Faith, the very Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scripture, uſually ſome Goſpel Promiſe: For inſtance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whoever believes in Chriſt ſhall have Eternal Life;</hi> the minor is the language of Spiritual ſence, <hi>I believe in Chriſt;</hi> the Concluſion from both is, <hi>Therefore I ſhall have Eternal Life;</hi> which following the major propoſition which is of Faith, and therefore inevident, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in a Logical ſence the weaker (though Theologically more ſtrong, as being more certain) is it ſelf of Faith too, and therefore moſt certain. No man that believes the Scripture will deny the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and he that ſhall deny the Minor, muſt deny all Spiritual ſence, and the reflection of a gracious Soul upon its own Actions, and ſo all poſſibility of Aſſurance in any ſuch way of ratiocination, and then he may well deny the comfort of Aſſurance, when he takes away Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it ſelf. And therefore there needs no more to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of this kind of comfort (which is ſo ſtrong and ſatisfactory to the Soul of a Believer, that he is never at reſt in himſelf till he have attained to it) than to prove the being of that Aſſurance from whence it proceeds, and all the Arguments which evince the one, will inferr the other; he that ſhall grant a man may be ſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, cannot doubt but he may take abundant comfort, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in being ſo aſſured, and that that Comfort is no Fancy.

            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to have been ſpoken to the firſt General propounded; That a true Believer may give an account of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and ſuch a one as is ſatisfactory to himſelf, and ought to be to others; he may make it appear that that ſerious Godlineſs in the practice of which he lives, is more than a Fancy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come to the ſecond General mentioned, to give Directions, and ſhew in anſwer to the Caſe, How we may experience this in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and evidence it in others.</p>
            <p>There be two parts of the Queſtion which muſt be diſtinctly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to; How we may experience this in our ſelves; and then, How we may evidence it in others.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>How may a Believer experience in himſelf, that that Serious Godlineſs he lives in the Practice of, is more than a Fancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>See that your Religiouſneſs came into you the right way,</hi> was wrought in you by the Word of God, the power of which ye have found changing your Hearts, and reforming your Lives: When men leap into Religion they know not how, can give no account to themſelves of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or Reformation, that the Word which is the Ordinary means God uſeth in converting Sinners hath had any influence upon them in working ſuch a change, it is ſuſpicious that what they take to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in themſelves is not reall; that which is unaccountable is moſt like to be a Fancy. True, a man may not know the juſt time when God did work Grace in his heart, nor the particular Word which was the Seed of it, or which did firſt draw the heart to a cloſing with the Promiſe, and ſubjecting it ſelf to the terms of the Goſpel; he may not know when the new man was firſt quickned in him, not be able to diſcern diſtinctly the firſt vital motions of Grace in his Soul; ſome may have been wrought on in their Education, by which they have been reſtrained from more groſs Sins, and influenced to ſome diligence in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, and in them the paſſing from one extream to the other, from a ſtate of Nature to a ſtate of Grace, may not be ſo remarkable, and therefore not ſo eaſily diſcerned. However a change they find, and that the Word hath wrought it, whch they have experienced Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in many things; it hath been the means at one time or other of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning their minds, melting their hearts, exciting their affections, directing their ways, and refreſhing their Spirits; though they cannot ſay what truth wrought the firſt degree of Grace, yet they can ſay ſuch and ſuch truths have had an influence upon them, and promoted the work whenever it was wrought; ſuch a Command quickned them to their Duty, another brought them off from ſome evil way, another helped them when they were tempted; ſuch a Promiſe ſupported them when burdened, eaſed them when troubled, or comforted them when caſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42587:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> down, and ſo what good they have done, the Word hath put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, what evil they have eſcaped that hath kept them from it, what refreſhment they have had, that hath brought it in. They know they are in their journey to Heaven, and that they do not Dream that they are ſo, becauſe if they cannot tell which was abſolutely the firſt ſtep they took in the way, yet they are ſenſible of many Stages they have travelled, many removes they have made; what accidents have befallen them, what difficulties they have met with, what Guide they had, what directions were given them; their journeying agrees with the map of their way; the <hi>Word hath been a light to their Feet, and a Lamp to their Paths</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 119.105.</note>, that hath ſtill gone before them, and conducted them in their march, <hi>and their ſteps have been ordered according to it</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Pſa. 119.133.</note>: they have not taken up a Religion at a days warning, not paſſed from being prophane and worldly to be even ſuperſtitiouſly ſtrict all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuddain, without being able to give a reaſon of ſo great a change. Look therefore to the way of Gods working upon you, and the means he made uſe of in it, and though you cannot trace the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his grace in all the particular ſteps he hath taken; yet ye may conclude it to be his Work, and not your own fancy, becauſe it was wrought in his way, and by his Word, which is his uſual Inſtrument in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See to your <hi>Faith as to the Foundation of it, and the Effects of it;</hi> that it be rightly grounded, and rightly qualified, built upon the Word, and fruitfull in good works.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See to the <hi>Foundation of it, that it be the Word it ſelf, and not your own miſtakes about it.</hi> When men miſunderſtand the Scripture, and ſo believe it, they Build on their own Errors, not Gods Truth, and then what they call Faith is but a Fancy, as not being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Word of God, but their own Conceits. See therefore that ye rightly underſtand what ye profeſs to believe, and know the mind of God in the Word, and ſo indeed believe what he ſpeaks, not what you imagine. See that your Faith reſpect Commands as well as Promiſes, Duties as well as Priviledges, what you are to do, as well as what you are to expect; God joyns both together, and if you ſeperate them, you ſet up a Conceit of your own inſtead of his Truth. Take heed of believing Promiſes as abſolute, when they are conditional, or when made with ſome limitations or reſtrictions, or when they ſuppoſe the uſe of ſome means preſcribed by the Command; in ſuch caſes men may think they believe when they do not; there being no right Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for their Faith, they believe what God never ſpoke. This fallacy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears when men apply Promiſes to themſelves, but overlook the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Command annexed; as ſuppoſe believe they ſhall be Pardoned, though they never deſire to be purged, ſhall <hi>find mercy</hi> though they do not <hi>forſake Sin,</hi> contrary to the tenour of the Word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. or that they ſhall <hi>ſee God</hi> though they do not <hi>follow after holineſs,</hi> contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And ſo when they believe one promiſe, and not another, the Promiſe of Juſtification, but not of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42587:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> when yet there is a connexion between them, and to whom one belongs, the other belongs too. In a word, let your Faith take in its Object in the whole Latitude, there being the ſame reaſon (Gods Authority) for your believing one truth, as well as another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>See to the Effects and Fruits of it,</hi> the reality of it muſt be proved by the fruits of it; a Barren Faith is a dead Faith, and indeed if any Faith be a Fancy it is the Faith of thoſe that live deſtitute of Holineſs, and under the Dominion of Sin, and yet expect Eternal Salvation; bring forth no <hi>Fruit to Holineſs,</hi> and yet hope <hi>the End</hi> will be <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Faith will work as long as it lives, and where there is no Fruit you may be ſure there is no Root; if it Act not, it lives not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore <hi>look to your Obedience too,</hi> not only that it <hi>be</hi> (as in the former) but that it be <hi>Right,</hi> and ſuch as it ſhould be, that is, <hi>Regular, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, Spiritual,</hi> for otherwiſe it is not reaſonable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Regular,</hi> ſuch as the Word of God calls for, and hath its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from thence: whatſoever we do in the things of God, and what we would have look'd on as Acts of Obedience, ſhould be done with a reſpect to Gods Commands, and not of our own heads: Obedience it is not, if it be not Commanded. Men may do many ſeemingly good things, and place Religion in them, and think they pleaſe God by them, which yet may be no true Acts of Obedience to him, becauſe not according to his Word: They do but obtrude a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon God, and Fancy it will pleaſe him, becauſe it pleaſeth them; Whereas indeed nothing is acceptable to him, but what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by him; Nothing is Duty but that which hath a Warrant from God for the Performance of it. Men may abound in Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and come ſhort in Obedience; they may do more than is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them, and yet leſs too; much which will never be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, as it was never required of them. You muſt judge of your ſelves not meerly by what you do, but by the ground you have for the doing of it, when Gods Will is the Reaſon of it, and not the Precepts of men, nor your own Fancies; ſo much, and no more, you do for God as you do in Obedience to his Command.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> both as to the <hi>extenſiveneſs</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to its <hi>Extenſiveneſs.</hi> See that you be not <hi>Partial in the Law</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mal. 2.9.</note>, that you walk with God in <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> Luke, 1.6. <hi>have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all</hi> his <hi>Commandements, Pſal.</hi> 119.6. There is the ſame reaſon for Obedience to one Command as well as another<hi rend="sup">b</hi>, Gods Authority who is the Law-giver; and therefore when men chuſe one Duty, and overlook others, they do not ſo much obey the will of God, as gratifie their omn Humours and Fancies, pleaſing him only ſo far as they can pleaſe themſelves too, and this is not reaſonable; we never yield him a reaſonable Service, but when it is univerſal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As to its Continuance</hi> and duration. If Gods Command be ſtill the ſame, and the Obligation of it, it is but reaſonable that our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience likewiſe ſhould be ſtill the ſame. Conſtancy and Perſeverance in

When a Chriſtians carriage is uniform in the courſe of his Life, and ſtill continues the ſame in a congruity and ſuitableneſs to his Principles, it can hardly be imagined that it ſhould be the effect of meer Fancy, but muſt proceed from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him more fixed, and ſettled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual.</hi> If the Obedience we yield to God be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Nature who is a Spirit, ſo far it is reaſonable, and that is ſuch as Chriſt requires, and this the reaſon he gives for it, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in truth.</hi> See therefore that the Service you do him, be not meerly external, and carnal, but inward and Spiritual.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Spiritual in its Principle.</hi> The goodneſs of your outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceeds eſpecially from within, and you cannot judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, but by the Principles from which they proceed, thoſe Principles are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> Your work muſt be the <hi>work of Faith</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1.3.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual in the End for which ye Act.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.31. See that whatever you do, you do it <hi>for the Glory of God</hi> as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme End.

               <note n="e" place="margin">Philip. 1.20.</note>; and ſo in doing, or ſuffering, that Obedience which is not only qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified as before mentioned, but is directed to ſuch an End. is not Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor the effetct of Fancy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual in the Acts of it:</hi> not that all Goſpel Obedience, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42587:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> Worſhip conſiſts only in the internal Acts, and workings of the Mind; for external Worſhip it ſelf may be ſpiritual Worſhip, and ſo it is when rightly performed, that is, when it is accompanied with, and proceeds from internal; but by <hi>Spiritual in its Acts,</hi> I mean that which principally conſiſts in the inward Acts of Faith, and Love, and Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a <hi>Serving God in our Spirits</hi>

Do not reſt in the outſide of Duty, nor ſatisfie your ſelves with what you do, when yet it is without life and warmth; have as much regard to the Manner of Performing, as to Performance it ſelf, to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your Hearts, as to the Labour of your Lips or poſtures of your Bodies. To conclude this direction, let your work in the whole of your converſation be as much about your Hearts<note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note>, as your Lives: be the ſame in ſecret that you are in publick, the ſame when under Gods Eye only, that you are in the Face of the World.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let Grace influence you in all you do, even in your ordinary Civil actions;</hi> do all graciouſly, do your common work as your Duty, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in your Callings, enjoy your Refreſhments, viſit your Friends, make uſe of your Recreations with a ſenſe of Duty, and an eye to God; do all as commanded by him, and with a reſpect to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and your own Salvation: in a word, Intereſt God in all, let all be done by his Grace as the ruling and directing Principle, and when ye find it ſo powerful, ye may well believe it to be real.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Labour to out do all you ever did while in a ſtate of Nature:</hi> Think what have been the higheſt actions you have ever been put upon, not only by Fancy or humour, but by the beſt Reaſon you then had, by natural Conſcience or good Education, or legal Convictions, or any preſent impreſſions from things without, and then make it your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to outdo them all; labour ſo to act, as nothing leſs than

Some Graces may be further off from your natural tempers than others, be more in the exerciſe of them; and ſome Corruptions may be more agreeable to them, ſo in ſome Pride is, in others Anger, in others Fear, be ſure exerciſe your ſelves eſpecially to beat them down; go contrary to the ſtream, and current of your own inclinations; it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a Fancy, that can either outdo the beſt of nature, or mend its worſt: Mans Fancies uſually have ſome foundation in their tempers, and diſpoſitions, and therefore as their tempers are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſo are their Fancies too, ſome carry them one way, ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for the moſt part it is for the promoting, or gratifying ſome natural inclination, and then that which croſſeth ſuch inclinations moſt, is moſt like to be ſomething conſtant and fixed. Fancy will hardly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42587:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> overcome Nature in a wrathful man, and make him become meek and gentle; nor make one that is dull and phlegmatick, active and zealous; nor a proud perſon humble, nor a churl liberal; though where Grace meets with a good diſpoſition, it makes the greater ſhew, as ſuppoſe gracious Meekneſs in one who hath already a natural meekneſs, yet the power of Grace is eſpecially ſeen in its influence upon ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in mens natures as are moſt contrary to it, when it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them, regulates them, or makes men act moſt oppoſitely to them. And that which thus rectifies the moſt crooked diſpoſitions, ſweetens an harſh Nature, moderates a furious one, elevates a dull one, whatever it be, it is more than a Fancy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Labour to act to ſuch an height of Holineſs, and walk ſo cloſely with God, that ye may have ſome ſenſible Communion with him in Duties and Ordinances;</hi> that you may <hi>ſee his Power and his Glory in his Sanctuary,</hi> Pſal. 63.2.

You will find Gods Conſolations carry their own Evidence along with them, and ſpeak their own reality; they have ſomething Divine in them, ſuch a Stamp of God upon them, that they will ſatisfie your Hearts as to their being no delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and then let Scoffers ſcoff on, they ſhall never be able to laugh you out of thoſe Comforts whereof you find ſuch real effects, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving your Hearts, enlivening your Graces, breaking the Snares of worldly Temptations, abating the force of your Luſts, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even your outward Converſations: I dare ſay, they may as ſoon perſwade you that Honey is not ſweet, when yet you taſt it, Snow not white, when yet you ſee it is, or not cold when you feel it ſo, as perſwade you, either that theſe Comforts are not real, or that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principle in you which is attended by them, is but Fantaſtical.</p>
            <p>To theſe Directions I ſhall add two general Rules, by which you may beſt judge if you would paſs a right Verdict on your ſelves, as to your ſpiritual State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When you would judge of the reality of Grace in your Hearts, <hi>Judge of your ſelves by what you are alone in the moſt ſecret Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42587:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> Cloſet-Prayer, Meditation, Self-Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What men are when alone, that uſually they are for the main; the Heart which may be awed or ſome way ſwayed when in Company with others, is moſt apt to diſcover it ſelf then: if ever Grace be working at all it will be at ſuch a time, and if none appear then, it is odds but there is none in the Heart. As ſome Corruptions may be moſt apt to ſhew themſelves (ſuch is the ſecret Atheiſm of mens Hearts, and little ſence of Gods Preſence) in ſecret, when men are free from the reſtraint of Fear and Shame; and ſuch like motives which many times give check to, and keep them under, in the Company of others, ſo likewiſe Grace may more readily act in ſecret where men may uſe ſuch means, and take ſuch liberty for the awakening, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, as might not in the preſence of others be ſo convenient, and be rid withall of ſome Temptations which at leaſt in ſome tempers may prove a hinderance to the more free actings of it. If you would therefore take the juſt meaſure of your ſpiritual Stature, and know what in you is real, do it when alone, when retired, when your Hearts are moſt like to diſcover themſelves fairly, and have leaſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to deceive you, or impoſe upon you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be curious and diligent, in obſerving,</hi> not only the inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your Souls, but <hi>the ordinary ſettled inclination, and main bent of your Hearts;</hi> obſerve them therefore, as to what they are in the main, and not only what they are by fits, at ſome certain times, or when it may be under Temptations. The Heart of a carnal man may ſeem to be very good under a pang of Conſcience, or fit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, or in relation to ſome more groſs and ſcandalous ſin, which yet in the general is ſtark naught. <hi>Ahab</hi> may humble himſelf and put on Sackcloth, when under the apprehenſions of threatned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note n="q" place="margin">1 King. 21.27.</note>; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may cry God mercy when under his hand<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 10.16, 17.</note>, and <hi>Herod</hi> may <hi>do many things</hi> when convinced by <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts Miniſtry<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mark 6.20.</note>, and yet ſtill they may continue the ſame they were: And on the other ſide, the Heart of a Saint may appear very wicked under a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as <hi>David</hi>'s did in the buſineſs of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and of Numbring the People, in both which Grace was for the preſent run down by a Luſt; and ſo many times Paſſion, or carnal Fears, or Diſtruſt may lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in the Saints, when yet there is Grace within, and that which at preſent appears is not the ordinary ſettled frame of their Hearts; and though whatever corruption at any time breaks out, you may be ſure it is within, yet that may not make a diſcovery of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual temper, and diſpoſition of your Spirits, nor argue that there is no Grace in you. Judge therefore of your ſelves by your courſe, and ordinary carriage, and by that you may ſee what is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in you; and if you find your Souls mainly looking to God, and reſpecting his wayes, and beſt pleaſed when ye keep cloſeſt to him, you may be ſure there is ſomething more in you than a Fancy or humour; you may in ſome particular <hi>go aſtray like loſt Sheep, and yet not forget Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. laſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:42587:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. The Second part of the Caſe is, <hi>How may we Evidence to others, that ſerious Godlineſs in us is more than a Fancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this there ſeems to be more difficulty than in the former; we may more eaſily ſatisfie our ſelves concerning our inward workings, and the temper of our own Minds, than we can others; we Judge of our ſelves by our inward actings, and Principles, of which by inſpecting our own Hearts, we have a more immediate knowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are leſs liable to be deceived in our Judgment; but when others have to do with us, they can judge of what is in our Hearts, only by our outward Carriage which is patent to them, and ſo are liable to more Errors in their thoughts about us: Here therefore if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give ſo clear proofs, and evident indications of a real Principle in us, as may work a full Conviction of it in Gainſayers and Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſo as to force them to an acknowledgment of it, it may be ſufficient if we can go ſo far, as to ſtop their mouths and put them to ſilence<note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.15.</note>, that they may not be able reaſonably to oppoſe, what yet they are unwilling to grant; and if it amount not to a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which may over-power their Reaſon, and compell it to yield us to be real in our Profeſſion, yet may (as before was intimated) lay an obligation upon their Charity to believe us to be ſo; and in this we muſt eſpecially have reſpect to that outward carriage of Profeſſors, which may make the beſt diſcovery of their inward frame, and is moſt obvious to the ſence, and obſervation of thoſe that are to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general, <hi>Let men ſee that you live up to the Faith you profeſs,</hi> that your Practice is agreable to your Principles, and then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the reality of your Faith when it is ſo powerful, nor the reaſonableneſs of your Practice, when it is ſo anſwerable to it. You profeſs before men to believe there is a God, let them ſee that you walk as before him, deſire to approve your ſelves to him, dare not ſin againſt him: you believe a Chriſt, let your Converſations be an imitation of him, <hi>Walk as he walked</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.6.</note>. You believe a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, live as becomes thoſe that would be able to ſtand in it, and give an account of your ſelves to the Judge. Let your carriage be ſuch as not only your own Conſciences, but your Adverſaries when they quarrel with you, tell you it ought to be; that is, ſuch as beſt ſuits your Faith, and Hope, even in their judgment as well as your own. What is it makes the profane World queſtion the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Godlineſs in Gods people, but becauſe they think they do not live and act as they ſhould do that believe ſuch weighty Truths, and expect ſuch great things as they profeſs they do? If therefore your Converſation be correſpondent to your Faith, you take away the great Cauſe of their cavilling with you, and ſlandering your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly; <hi>Be as much in acting for God, as ſpeaking for him.</hi> Not only commend his wayes, but walk in them; not only plead his Cauſe verbally, but really, by being in your proper Sphere,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42587:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> active for it, not only ſpeak well of them that are good, but do good to them. Many will ſpeak for God, and good men, but when it comes to doing, there is an end of their goodneſs, they will not ſtir a ſtep, not part with a penny: they can ſay as <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Be thou filled, and be thou warmed, and yet not give them thoſe things that are needful to the Body:</hi> they will be Religious as far as good words will go, which coſt them nothing, but are loath to be at the charges of doing any real good: How many have their Tongues tipt with good diſcourſe, whoſe Lives are unfruitful as to good works? See therefore that your actions keep pace with your words, that your Religion do not conſiſt meerly in talking, that will be a ſign it is either fantaſtical or hypocritical; when the Fruit of it reacheth no further than the Tongue, it is odds if the root reach any deeper than the head: but when your Religion appears in action, your Enemies themſelves will confeſs the reality of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be as diligent in and make as much Conſcience of the Duties of the ſecond Table, Righteouſneſs and Mercy, in their place and order, as thoſe of the firſt:</hi> Without this your Religion cannot <hi>be real,</hi> and then no wonder if men <hi>think it not real:</hi> Jam. 1.6. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled in the ſight of God, and the Father, is this, to viſit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and the Widdow, in their Affliction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the ſight of God;</hi> God himſelf that ſearches the Hearts, yet having given men ſuch a Law as may govern their owtuard as well as inward man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence them in thoſe things which relate to their Neighbour, as well as which relate to himſelf, doth accordingly look to their outward Carriage toward men, as well as the inward reſpect they bear to him, and ſo expects the fruits of Righteouſneſs in their Lives, as well as the root of Piety in their Hearts: That holy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple he hath put within them is ſuch as extends to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation outwardly, and not to the inward frame of their Hearts alone, and ſo the reality of it in it ſelf, muſt be evidenced by the power of it in its effects: Now if theſe external actings. (where opportunities and means are) are requiſite to aſcertain the Truth of Godlineſs in the Heart, as to its very being, we may be ſure they are no leſs neceſſary as indications of it in the ſight of men. The World, which is apt to traduce you as Hypocritical, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical in Religion, will be beſt confuted by your Carriage in thoſe things which relate to themſelves, and from which ſome benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to them. If men ſee you Juſt, and Righteous, and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your dealings with, and behaviour toward others, Helpful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that want you, Pitiful to them in their Miſery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what is in your Hearts and Minds they cannot ſee, but they will be more ready to judge well of it, becauſe they ſee ſo good Effects of it; what they ſee, they will think is real becauſe it is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. True indeed, the firſt place is due to the Moral Duties of Gods immediate Worſhip preſcribed in the firſt Table, but yet thoſe of the ſecond muſt accompany them, or you will never be able to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42587:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> prove the reality of your Chriſtianity, or reaſonableneſs of your Practice to your ſelves, and much leſs to others. They muſt and will judge of what is within, by that which appears without, of what they do not ſee (as your Faith and inward Holineſs they do not) by that which they do ſee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be moſt diligent in thoſe Duties which all own to be Duties,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt or ſecond Table; thoſe which are confeſſedly Moral, and which your Enemies themſelves cannot deny to be Duties. Some Duties have an intrinſick <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> in them, and are of <hi>good report</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note> even among thoſe themſelves that are but Carnal. Theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conviction along with them, and if you be diligent in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, you will have the Conſciences of your Adverſaries take part with you, and their Judgments to applaud you, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Malice cenſures you, and their Luſts oppoſe you: you will have ſomething within them to bear teſtimony to you, and when they do not love you, yet they cannot condemn you.</p>

If they be juſt, do you be more juſt, either more exactly, or more univerſally, or more conſtantly ſo; If they be temperate and ſober, if it be poſſible go beyond them in it; if they be Charitable, be you more Charitable; if they be Humble, Meek, Gentle, Courteous, endeavour to excell them in each: if you think that cannot be in ſome caſes, yet it is but in ſome, and may you not exceed them as to the general courſe and whole of a moral Converſation? Labour then to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that a Nobler Principle out of which you act, an higher End at which you aim, and a more perfect Copy after which you write, can raiſe and heighten you to a pitch above any thing not only that Fancy might do in you, but natural Conſcience, or moral Virtue in them. And though the beſt and higheſt of ſuch moral performances in your external Converſation, might be in themſelves but inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent arguments, as to your own perſonal ſatisfaction, of the truth of Grace in your hearts, yet your overtopping others in what they excell moſt, or in the main of your Life and Practice, may be an argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and be a means to ſilence Enemies, and ſtop their mouths, it may be convince their judgments; or if it do not make them acknowledge what you do to proceed from a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principle, it may however force them to own it as coming from ſomething more than a Conceit or Fancy.</p>

When men appear for Religion only when, and where it is countenanced, or while there is ſomething to be got by it, Practice in an Employment, Cuſtom in a Trade, or the favour of men, or applauſe from them, they may well be ſuſpected if not of Fancy, yet of Deſign, and Hypocriſie. But when men will do Duty and keep Gods way though they get nothing by it, but frowns, or blowes, detriment, or danger, it cannot be reaſonably imagined but that they have ſome better thing in their eye which they look for hereafter, and ſome very Powerful Principle at preſent within them, to ſupport them under difficulties, and prompt them to ſuch Duties, as are (for ought the ſpectators can diſcern) both unprofitable, and hazardous.</p>

Scarce any thing is a greater blemiſh to Religion, or diſreputation to them that profeſs it, than their paſſionate, and over-eager purſuit of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, with a coldneſs and viſible indifferency in ſeeking Eternal: when they can riſe up early, and ſit up late, and eat the bread of Carefulneſs, ſpend their time and ſtrength in labouring for the World; nay, loſe the comfort of their Lives by ſcrambling for the things of this life; and in the mean time put God off with ſome little ſuperficial Service, neglect ſome duties and hurry over others, let the croud of buſineſs thruſt their ſpiritual work into a corner of their time, if not quite out of it; the world indeed juſtle God and Chriſt, and Heaven out of their diſcourſe and converſation, which ſavours of nothing but Trades, and Bargains and Adventures, and getting Eſtates, and tends to nothing but the promoting a meer Worldly Intereſt. Are theſe men, think their carnal Neighbours, in good earneſt for Religion, when they are ſo mad upon their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? doth their Happineſs lie in Heaven, when their labour is only for the Earth? can their Treaſure be above, when their hearts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and their actings plainly ſhew that they are ſo? can their hope of Eternal Glory be any better than a Fancy, who do ſo little for that Glory, and lay out themſelves for this World as if there were no other? And indeed who can judge otherwiſe of ſome men, that hears their pretences, and yet ſees their practice? And therefore Chriſtians, think with your ſelves, How doth it become you to act, if you would perſwade others that you have real deſigns for future happineſs? What would you do, if you did pretend to the hope of ſome great Eſtate, or enjoyment in the world, to convince them that that hope were reaſonable and well grounded? would you not act at ſuch a rate, as to make them acknowledge you were ſerious? would you not make it your great buſineſs to attain your great Ends?

Thoſe comforts cannot but be real which have ſo great, ſo good Effects, and when men ſee the effects ſo real, they cannot judge the cauſe to be leſs ſo.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whereon it is grounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When their Faith is not rightly grounded it is no better than a Fancy.</hi> When it is built on the Authority of a Church, or the Traditions of men and not on the Word of God; or on the Word miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or miſapplied, or divided, or maimed; when they believe Promiſes without reſpect to Commands, believe Chriſt is their Saviour, and yet never receive him to be their Lord; believe they ſhall <hi>See God,</hi> though they be not <hi>pure in Heart, follow not after Holineſs,</hi> and ſuch indeed is the Faith and Hope of Prophane Worldlings, and whoever live in Contradiction to Gods Commands, and yet expect the benefit of his Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When their Practice is not rightly grounded, it is no better than Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> how fair ſoever and plauſible it may ſeem. When men ſet up a Religion meerly of mans deviſing, contrive new wayes of Worſhipping God, which he himſelf never appointed, and ſo indeed impoſe upon him, and preſcribe to him what they think muſt certainly pleaſe him. This is unreaſonable, for men to think that their Inventions or others Traditions can be more acceptable to God than his own Inſtitutions, that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> can go further than <hi>Obedience</hi> would have done. They would themſelves be ſerved according to their own minds and not their Servants pleaſure, and why ſhould not God? They would not have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42587:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> their Commands neglected that their Servants Will might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and how fooliſh is it then to adhere to their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions though with the ſlighting of Gods Inſtitutions? and yet how few be there that are ſo addicted to Humane Obſervances, but they are careleſs of Gods Appointments? Gods Commands being the Great, and only Warrantable reaſon of all Divine Worſhip, whatever Worſhip is uncommanded, cannot be but unreaſonable.</p>

All the Religion they own conſiſts but in a few outward Forms, or ſome moral Actions, and whatever is above this they look upon as not real; and ſo they leave us a Lamentably empty Religion, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our Faith as Fancy, our Practice as Folly, and caſheer all our Comforts as meer Deluſions. This uſually proceeds either</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Atheiſm and Infidelity of ſuch mens Hearts,</hi> ſome Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Religion and ſo the true Religion among the reſt; they are themſelves for none, and therefore Quarrel with all; they think all Religion is but Fancy, or Policy, and ſo the Chriſtian Religion too: They do not really believe the Grounds of Chriſtianity, and therefore laugh at them that do.</p>

Or, from <hi>Pride and Conceitedneſs of their own Wiſdom and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> they magnifie their own Notions, are in love with their own Wiſdom, and ſo contemn all elſe, like the <hi>Athenians, Acts.</hi> 17.18.32. that laugh'd when they heard of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the Reſurrection. The high Opinion they have of their Reaſon makes them deny the reality of Faith; what they cannot themſelves comprehend, they will not believe, nor allow others to do it; they will ſcarce allow of any thing between Demonſtration and Fancy, and this makes them Innovate ſo much in Religion, and Scoff at the Faith by which they ſhould be Saved.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>But I take the <hi>Queſtion</hi> only to intend, What ſerious Chriſtians may and ought to endeavour, <hi>in their Private Capacities,</hi> and <hi>agreeably with their own Principles,</hi> towards the propoſed End.</p>
            <p>And ſo I conceive the words read to you, contain the <hi>Materials</hi> of a direct, and full anſwer to the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Which I reckon will appear, by opening <hi>the Caſe</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words have reference to; that will be found a Caſe like our own; and by opening <hi>the Words,</hi> whereby their ſuitableneſs <hi>to that Caſe</hi> will be ſeen, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>our Caſe</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Caſe</hi> which theſe words have reference to (as indeed the general aſpect of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and in great part of the other <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Letters,</hi> looks much the ſame way) was in ſhort this. That a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Sect was already ſprung up, that began (ſo early) to corrupt the ſimplicity, and purity of the Chriſtian Religion, and very much to diſturb the peace of the Chriſtian Church. A ſort they were of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Judaizing,</hi> partly <hi>Paganizing</hi> Chriſtians, (the Diſciples as they are reputed of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>) who joyned with the name <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> with the <hi>impurities</hi> (even in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> denying the more <hi>principal Doctrines,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>holy deſign</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, while thy ſeem'd to have aſſumed (or to retain) the <hi>Name,</hi> as it were on purpoſe the more effectually to wound and injure the Chriſtian Cauſe and Intereſt. Men of high pretence to knowledge (whence they had the Title of <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi>) filched partly from the <hi>Jewiſh Cabbaliſme,</hi> partly from the <hi>Phytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean.</hi> By which pretence they inſinuated the more plauſibly with ſuch as affected the knowledge of more hidden Myſteries. Whereto the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſeems to have reference, where he addes immediatey after the Text, that <hi>in Christ were hid all the Treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> verſ. 3. And ſayes he, did purpoſely adde it, <hi>leſt any man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile them with enticing words.</hi> Intimating, there was no need to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe vain Pretenders, out of an affectation of ſublimer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and forſake Chriſt in whom all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge were hid.</p>
            <p>Of the progreſs and Genius of this Sect, not only ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church give an account<note n="†" place="margin">Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andr. Irenaeus, Epiphanius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>It appears this ſort of men did, in the Apoſtles dayes, not only ſet themſelves, with great art and induſtry, to pervert as many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity as they could, but found means (as they might
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42587:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> by their compliances with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then much ſpread, and numerouſly ſeated in ſundry principal Cities under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and who were every where the bittereſt enemies to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity) to raiſe Perſecution againſt them they could not pervert, which ſome paſſages ſeem to intimate in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi> (who, as that whole <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſhews, were much leaven'd by this <hi>Sect,</hi> inſomuch that the Apoſtle is put to <hi>travel as in birth again,</hi> to have <hi>Chriſt formed in them,</hi> and to reduce them back to ſincere Chriſtianity,) <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome <hi>leaders</hi> of this <hi>Sect,</hi> ſo ſet the Peoples minds even againſt the Apoſtle himſelf, that he began to be reputed by them <hi>as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> chap 4.16. and was perſecuted under that notion, becauſe he would not comply with them in the matter of Circumciſion (urged as an engagement to the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,) chap.</hi> 5.11. <hi>If I yet preach Circumciſion, why do I yet ſuffer perſecution? Then is the offence of the Croſs ceaſed.</hi> And that they were as miſchievous as they could be, to fellow-Chriſtians, on the ſame account, <hi>biting and devouring</hi> them that received not their corrupting Additions to Chriſtianity, as the circumſtances of the Text ſhew, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>How like a Caſe this is to ours, with our <hi>Popiſh Enemies,</hi> I need not tell you. And now in this Caſe; when the Faith of many was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, ſo much hurt was already done, and the danger of greater was ſo manifeſt, partly by the moſt inſinuating methods of Seduction, partly by the terror of Perſecution, the great care was to ſecure the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted reſidue, and preſerve unextinct <hi>the true Christian Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The urgency of this Caſe puts the ſolicitous, concerned ſpirit of this great Apoſtle, into an inexpreſſible Agony, as his words do intimate. <hi>I would you knew what conflict I have, and not for theſe Coloſſians only, but for them of Laodicea</hi> (which was not very remote from <hi>Coloſſe) and for as many as have not ſeen my face in the fleſh:</hi> For it was a common Caſe; and upon him lay the <hi>care of all the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that hence his muſing, meditative Mind, could not but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving many thoughts, and caſting about for Expedients, how the threatning danger might be obviated and averted. And <hi>theſe</hi> in the Text, which he faſtens upon, and wherein his thoughts center, how apt and proper they were to that Caſe (and conſequently to ours which ſo little differs) will be ſeen</p>
            <p n="2">2. By our opening and viewing the Import of the Text it felf: Wherein he</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               </gap> ſignifies (with profane as well as the ſacred Writers) not only to adminiſter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to a grieved Mind, but to exhort, quicken, excite, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, to plead and ſtrive with dull and ſtupid, wavering and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved minds. It was thought indeed comprehenſive enough to expreſſe all the Operations of the divine Spirit upon the Souls of men, when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42587:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> not only the Chriſtian Church, but the World, yet to be Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd, was to be the Subject of them, as we ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof that holy Spirit hath its name of Office, <hi>the Paraclet,</hi> from this word. And it being the <hi>paſſive</hi> that is here uſed, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not only the <hi>endeavours themſelves,</hi> which are uſed to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here intended, but the <hi>effect</hi> of them wherein they all terminate, a <hi>lively, vigorous, confirm'd State and habit of Soul.</hi> And that not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, but determined to <hi>one thing, the Chriſtian Faith and Profeſſion,</hi> which the Apoſtles drift, and ſcope plainly ſhewes. 'Tis not to be thought he ſo earneſtly coveted and ſtrove that they might be jocund, chearful, abounding with joy and courage, in any courſe, right or wrong. But that they might be encouraged, eſtabliſh't, confirm'd <hi>in their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> And if the word he here uſes were large enough to ſignifie (as was noted above) all that was neceſſary to make men Chriſtians, it may as well all that is neceſſary to continue them ſuch.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the end which the Apoſtle aims at, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> intended to theſe Chriſtians, was their Eſtabliſhment and confirm'd State in their Chriſtianity, as the Effect of all Apoſtolical, or Miniſterial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Perſwaſions, Encouragments, or any whatſoever endeavours; made efficacious to that purpoſe by the powerful. Influence and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And that it was no lower thing than <hi>this,</hi> we have ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by comparing the <hi>cloſe</hi> of the foregoing <hi>chapter</hi> with the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of <hi>this.</hi> Where we find <hi>chap.</hi> 1.28. the avowed deſign of his <hi>preaching, warning and teaching in all wiſdom,</hi> was <hi>that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That whereas there were various Arts and Endeavours uſed, to adulterate the Chriſtian Religion, and pervert men from the ſimplicity of it, he might loſe none, but to his very uttermoſt keep all in a poſſibility of being preſented perfect in Chriſt Jeſus at laſt. <hi>i. e.</hi> That they might be all entire, compleat, and perſevering Chriſtians to the end. And <hi>for this</hi> he adds, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>he did labour, ſtriving according to his working, which wrought in him mightly.</hi> All his labour, and the ſtrivings of his Soul, acted by divine Power, and by a Spirit greater than his own, did aim at this End. And now hereupon he intimates how fervid theſe his ſtrivings were. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. I would you did but know (what it is not for me to ſay) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, what an <hi>Agony</hi> I endure! how great this my <hi>conflict</hi> is for you, and for them at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and for as many as have not ſeen my face in the fleſh! And for what? <hi>That their Hearts might be comforted</hi> (as we read) meaning manifeſtly the ſame thing he had expreſt before; that notwithſtaning all endeavours of others to the contrary, <hi>they might be compleat and confirm'd Chriſtians to the laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have next to conſider in the Text the <hi>means,</hi> or what <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients</hi> the Apoſtle conceives would be moſt effectually conducing to this bleſſed purpoſe. They are two,

            <p n="1">1. <hi>What he would have them apprehend; viz.</hi> The Summ and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which he calls a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo in it ſelf, and 'tis often ſpoken of, under that name by our Lord himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. and familarly by this <hi>Apoſtle, Rom.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 3.3, 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. and elſewhere. And becauſe of the high pretence of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> to the knowledge of Myſteries, which ſometimes he ſlights. Eſpecially being unaccompanied with Love, as with them it moſt eminently was. <hi>Thô I underſtand all Mysteries, and all knowledge, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffeth up, love edifies.</hi> chap. 8.1. Sometimes, as here, he makes the ſincere Doctrine of the Goſpel to outvy <hi>theirs</hi> herein, intimating that ſuch as made Profeſſion of it could have no Temptation to go over to <hi>them,</hi> for the knowledge of Myſteries (unleſs <hi>a Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> were more pleaſing to them) whoſe very Religion was that Great <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs. God was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtify'd in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preacht unto the Gentles, believed on in the World, received up into glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Myſtery</hi> he, <hi>firſt,</hi> more generally characterizes, by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> a divine Myſtery, not made one, by meerly humane fiction; and then he very diſtinctly ſpecifies it in the following words, <hi>and of the Father and of Chriſt.</hi> Where the former <hi>[and]</hi> needs not be thought <hi>copulative,</hi> but <hi>exegetical,</hi> and might be read <hi>even,</hi> or <hi>to wit,</hi> or it may be read, <hi>both,</hi> as 'tis uſual with the <hi>Greeks</hi> as well as <hi>Latines</hi> when the <hi>copulative</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, ſo to read the former. As if it were ſaid, by the <hi>Myſtery of God</hi> I mean, <hi>not of God alone,</hi> and abſtractly conſidered; as if it were enough to you to be meer <hi>Deiſts;</hi> and that the whole ſuperadded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation <hi>concerning the Mdiatour,</hi> might be look't upon <hi>with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency or neglect</hi> (as by the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> it was known <hi>then</hi> to be, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by ſome of their great leaders, <hi>in the ſubſtance</hi> of it, <hi>with down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42587:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> hatred and oppoſition</hi>) but that which I ſo earneſtly covet for you, and wherein I would have you <hi>unite,</hi> and be <hi>all one,</hi> is <hi>the acknowledgement of the</hi> whole <hi>Myſtery of God;</hi> i. e. <hi>both</hi> of the <hi>Father, and of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apprehenſive Principle;</hi> which we may, by a general name, call Faith, and accommodately enough to the name here given us of its object, a <hi>Myſtery</hi> which is elſewhere called <hi>the Myſtery of Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. or a <hi>Myſtery to be believed.</hi> Faith being the known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of receiving the Goſpel revelation.

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thereby intimating that the <hi>Faith of Chriſtians</hi> is not to be a blind and unintelligent Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that though there were contained in the Goſpel, Myſteries never to be underſtood, if God had not afforded a ſpecial Revelation of them on purpoſe; yet <hi>being revealed,</hi> we ought to have a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, as well as lively and practical perception of them. By theſe two words, and the other expreſſions he joyns in with the former, he ſeems to intimate <hi>two ſorts of properties</hi> which belong to that Faith of the Goſpel which he wiſhes to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The rectitude, clearneſs and certainty of notion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The efficacy, impreſſiveneſs, and immediate aptitude to have influence upon practice which he would have it carry with it. The latter properties ſuppoſing and depending on the former, he there highly exaggerates the matter, and heaps together expreſſions that might with moſt lively <hi>emphaſis</hi> ſet forth the kind of that knowledge which he conceives would be of ſo great uſe to them. He wiſhes them a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a clear, perſpicacious Knowledge, and an <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> even to a <hi>plerophory,</hi> a <hi>fulneſs of aſſurance</hi> in their knowledge of the truth of the Goſpel. Yea, he wiſhes them the <hi>Riches</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) yea and <hi>all Riches</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of that full aſſurance, or Plerophory of underſtanding, and knowledge of that Truth; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that this would certainly fix them in their Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſo as they would never recede from it. As when in Chriſts own daies many <hi>went back</hi> and walked no more with him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. That which retained others, ſo that when Chriſt asks, <hi>Will ye alſo go away? verſ.</hi> 67. they preſently anſwer, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we go?</hi> could entertain no ſuch thought, was that, beſides what they believed of him was of greateſt importance to them, <hi>thou haſt the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, verſ.</hi> 68. So their belief was with that aſſurance as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all ſuſpicion or doubt in the Caſe, <hi>and we believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> verſ. 69. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither canſt want <hi>Power</hi> to confer eternal Life, as all thy <hi>words</hi> do import thy deſign and promiſe to do, nor <hi>truth</hi> to make good thy own plain words. And then he alſo knew that ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or knowledge would produce, what he further wiſhes them an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an acknowledgement, an inward, vital owning, a cordial embrace, a lively perception of the ſame bleſſed Truths, which muſt needs further moſt abundantly contribute, to this their ſo much deſired joynt and unanimous ſtability.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42587:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And now theſe are the two expedients by which he reckons they would be ſo cloſely compacted together as that no <hi>ſubtilty</hi> or <hi>violence</hi> could endanger them, <hi>mutual love,</hi> and <hi>a clear, certain, operative Faith of the Goſpel;</hi> if, by the one they did cohere with each other; and by the other, adhere to God in Chriſt; if the one might have with them the place, power and bindingneſs of a <hi>cement,</hi> the other of a continual inclination, yieldingneſs, and compliance to the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm of the <hi>center,</hi> they would never ſo fall aſunder; as to give any enemies opportunity to be the ſuccesful authors, or the gratify'd Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of their ruine.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore I would ſumm up the <hi>ſenſe of this Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>anſwer to the queſtion</hi> propoſed.</p>
            <q>That the maintaining of ſincere Love among Chriſtians, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of their Faith to greater meaſures of clearneſs, certainty, and efficacy in reference to the ſubſtantials of Chriſtianity, are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured as the beſt means to unite, establiſh and preſerve them, against ſuch as deſign the ruine of the truly Christian Interest.</q>
            <p>The Caſe was at that time urging and important. A great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party was formed of ſuch as did nauſeate the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Religion and hate the true deſign of it. All the care was what courſe was moſt proper and ſuitable to preſerve the reſt. And you ſee what was then thought moſt proper.</p>
            <p>Counſel was not taken to this effect (and therefore Chriſtians in a private capacity ſhould not covet to have it ſo) <q>Let us bind them by certain deviſed preter-Evangelical Canons to things never thought fit to be enjoyn'd by Chriſt himſelf, ſeverely urge the ſtrict and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form obſervance of them, make the terms of Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſtraiter than he ever made them, adde new rituals of our own to his Inſtitutions, and cut off from us all that (never ſo conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly) ſcruple them.</q> No, this was the practice of their common enemies, and it was to narrow and weaken the too much already di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh't Chriſtian Intereſt. The <hi>Order</hi> mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. might be comely enough, without things that were both unneceſſary, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p>Nor was it conſulted and reſolved to agitate the <hi>Controverſy</hi> about this <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> in perpetual, endleſs diſputations, and ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize them that ſhould not be enlightned and ſatisfy'd in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as ſchiſmatical and wilful; thô they never ſo ſincerely adhered to the Doctrine and obſerved the Laws of Chriſt. <hi>i. e.</hi> 'Twas neither thought fit to urge the unſatisfy'd upon doubtful things againſt their Conſciences, nor to take order that continual endeavours ſhould be uſed from age to age to ſatisfy them, or that the Church ſhould be alwaies vexed with a vain controverſy about needleſs things; that, if they were never ſo lawful, might as well be let alone, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the Chriſtian Cauſe, and perhaps to its greater advantage.</p>
            <p>Yea the attempt of impoſing any thing upon the Diſciples but <hi>what was neceſſary,</hi> is judg'd a <hi>tempting of God, Acts.</hi> 15.10. a bringing the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42587:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> matter to a tryall of skill with him, whether he could keep the Church quiet, when they took ſo direct a courſe to diſtemper and trouble it.</p>
            <p>But it was thought neceſſary (and ſufficient) that all did unite, and were knit together in the mutual love of one another, and in a joynt adherence to the great myſteries of Faith, and Salvation.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſame caſe,</hi> when there were ſo <hi>many Antichrists</hi> abroad, and ('tis likely) <hi>Ebion</hi> with his <hi>partakers</hi> made it their buſineſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Chriſtian doctrine, the ſame courſe is taken by the bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> only to endeavour the ſtrengthning of theſe two vital principles <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Love to fellow-Chriſtians</hi> as may be ſeen at large in his Epiſtles. <hi>Theſe</hi> he preſſes, as the <hi>great commandments,</hi> upon the obſervation whereof he ſeems to account, the ſafety and peace of the ſincere did entirely depend. <hi>This is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another as he gave us Commandment.</hi> 1 Epiſtle, 3.23. He puts upon Chriſtians no other diſtinguiſhing teſt, but <hi>whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Christ, is born of God: And every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> chap. 5.1. Is only ſolicitous that they did practiſe <hi>the Commandment they had from the beginning,</hi> i. e. <hi>that they loved one another,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 5. and <hi>that they did abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 9.</p>
            <p>The <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> of thoſe <hi>unerring Guides of the Church,</hi> (themſelves under the certain guidance of the Spirit of truth) directed them to bring the things wherein they would have Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unite, within as narrow a compaſs as was poſſible, neither mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying <hi>articles of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>rites of Worſhip.</hi> Theſe <hi>two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> (as they were thought to anſwer the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) would fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>our</hi> deſign, and preſent enquiry. And we may adventure to ſay of them that they are both <hi>ſufficient,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> the <hi>apt</hi> and the <hi>only</hi> means to heal and ſave us; <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>would effect our cure,</hi> and <hi>without which nothing will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I give other anſwer to the propoſed queſtion, than what may be deduced from theſe two, conſidered according to what they are in themſelves, and what they naturally lead and tend unto.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider them in the order wherein the Apoſtle here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them, who you ſee reſerves the more important of them to the latter place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſincere love of Chriſtians to one another, would be an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py means of preſerving the truly Chriſtian Intereſt among us.</hi> That this may be underſtood, we muſt rightly apprehend what <hi>kind of love</hi> it is that is here meant. It is ſpecifi'd by what we find in conjunction with it, <hi>The underſtanding, and acknowledgment of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Christianity.</hi> Therefore it muſt be the <hi>love of Chriſtians</hi> to one another <hi>as ſuch.</hi> Whence we collect, leſt we too much extend the object of it on the one hand, or contract it on the other,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is not the love only which we owe to one another <hi>as men,</hi> or humane Creatures meerly, that is intended here. That
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42587:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> were too much to enlarge it, as to our preſent conſideration of it. For <hi>under that common notion,</hi> we ſhould be as much obliged to love the enemies we are to unite againſt, as the friends of Religion we are to unite with, ſince all partake equally in humane nature. It muſt be a more <hi>ſpecial love</hi> that ſhall have the deſired influence in the preſent caſe. We cannot be <hi>peculiarly</hi> endeared and united to ſome more than to others, upon a reaſon that is common to them with others. We are to love them that are <hi>born of God,</hi> and are <hi>his children,</hi> otherwiſe than the <hi>children of men,</hi> or ſuch of whom it may be ſaid <hi>they are of their father the Devil;</hi> them that appear to have been <hi>partakers of a divine nature</hi> at another rate, than them who have received a <hi>meer humane,</hi> or alſo <hi>the diabolical nature.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1.</p>
            <p>Yet this <hi>peculiar love</hi> is not to be excluſive of the other which is <hi>common,</hi> but muſt ſuppoſe it, and be ſuperadded to it, As the reaſon of it is ſuperadded. For Chriſtianity ſuppoſes humanity, and divine grace, humane nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is it a love to <hi>Chriſtians of this or that Party,</hi> or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination only. That were as much unduly to ſtraiten and confine it. The love that is owing to Chriſtians <hi>as ſuch,</hi> as it belongs <hi>to them only,</hi> ſo it belongs to <hi>all them</hi> who in profeſſion and practice do own ſincere, and incorrupt Chriſtianity. To limit our <hi>Chriſtian love</hi> to a <hi>Party of Chriſtians</hi> truly ſo called is ſo far from ſerving the purpoſe now to be aimed at, that it reſiſts and defeats it; and inſtead of a preſervative union, infers moſt deſtructive diviſions. It ſcatters what it ſhould collect and gather. 'Tis to love factious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and with an <hi>unjust</hi> love, that refuſes to give indifferently <hi>to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his due.</hi> (For is there no love due to <hi>a diſciple of Christ</hi> in the <hi>name of a diſciple?</hi>) It is founded in <hi>falſhood,</hi> and a <hi>lye;</hi> denies them to be of the Chriſtian community who really are ſo. It preſumes to remove the ancient land-marks, not <hi>civil</hi> but <hi>ſacred,</hi> and draws on not the <hi>peoples curſe</hi> only, but <hi>that</hi> of <hi>God himſelf.</hi> 'Tis true (and who doubts it?) that I may and ought upon <hi>ſpecial reaſons</hi> to love ſome more than others (as relation, acquaintance, obligation by favours received from them, more eminent degrees of true worth, and real goodneſs) but that ſignifies nothing to the withholding of that love which is due to a Chriſtian <hi>as ſuch,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> alſo ought not to prejudice the love I owe to a man, <hi>as he is a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor am I ſo promiſcuouſly to diſtribute this <hi>holy love,</hi> as to place it at randome, upon every one that thinks it convenient for him to call himſelf a Chriſtian, thô I ought to love the <hi>very profeſſion,</hi> while I know not who ſincerely make it, and do plainly ſee that <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> were never worſe enemies to Chriſt and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a great part of the Chriſtian world. But let my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions be once ſet right concerning the <hi>true eſſentials of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> (whether conſiſting <hi>in doctrinal or vital principles,</hi>) then will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42587:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> my love be duly carried to all in whom they are found <hi>under one common notion,</hi> which I come actually to apply to <hi>this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> as particular occaſions do occur. And ſo ſhall alwaies be <hi>in a preparation of mind</hi> actually to unite <hi>in Christian love</hi> with every ſuch perſon, whenſoever ſuch occaſions do invite me to it.</p>
            <p>And do we now need to be told what ſuch an <hi>impartial truly Christian love,</hi> would do to our common preſervation, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ruine of the Chriſtian Intereſt?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How greatly would it contribute to the vigour of the Chriſtian life?</hi> for ſo we ſhould all equally <hi>hold the head, from which all the body by joynts and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the increaſe of God.</hi> As afterwards in this Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. Thus (as it is in that other parallel text of Scripture) <hi>Speaking the truth in love, we ſhall grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joyn'd together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by that which every joynt ſupplieth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the body, unto the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it ſelf in love.</hi> Eph. 4.15, 16. <hi>Obſtructions</hi> that hinder the free circulation of blood and ſpirits, do not more certainly infer languiſhings in the natural body, than the want of ſuch a diffuſive love ſhuts up and ſhrivels the deſtitute parts, and hinders the diffuſion of a nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vital influence, in the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It would inſpire Chriſtians generally with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

They otherwiſe ſignifie but as ſo many ſingle perſons, each one but caring and contriving how to ſhift for himſelf. Love makes them ſignificant to one another. So as that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one underſtands himſelf to be the common care of all the reſt. It makes Chriſtians the more reſolute in their adherence to Truth and goodneſs, when (from their not-doubted love) they are ſure of the help, the counſels and prayers of the Chriſtian communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and apprehend by their declining they ſhall grieve thoſe whom they love, and who they know love them. If any imagine themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be given up as Sacrifices to the rage of the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, their hearts are the apter to ſink, they are moſt expos'd to temptations to prevaricate, and the reſt will be apt to expect the like uſage from <hi>them,</hi> if themſelves be reduc'd to the like exigency, and be liable to the ſame temptations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It would certainly in our preſent caſe, extinguiſh or abate the (ſo contrary) unhallow'd fire of our anger and wrath towards one another,</hi> as the Celeſtial beams do the baſer culinary fire, which burns more fervently when the Sun hath leſs power. Then would debates (if there muſt be any) be manag'd without intemperate heat. We ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42587:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> be remote from being angry that we cannot convey our own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into anothers mind; which, when we are, our buſineſs is the more remote; we make our ſelves leſs capable of reaſoning aptly to convince, and (becauſe anger begets anger, as love doth love) render the other leſs ſuſceptible of Conviction. Why are we yet to learn that <hi>the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God?</hi> What is gained by it? So little doth angry contention about ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters avail, that even they that happen to have the better cauſe loſe by it, and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The diſtemper of his own Spirit, what can recompenſe! and how apt is it to grow in him, and while it grows in himſelf to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it ſelf among others! Whereupon, if the want of love hinders the nouriſhment of the body, much more do the things, which, when it is wanting, are wont to fill up its place. For as naturally as love begets love, ſo do wrath, envy, malice, calumny, beget one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpread a poyſon and virulency through the body, which neceſſarily waſtes and tends to deſtroy it. How ſoon did the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church ceaſe to be it ſelf! and the early vigour of primitive Chriſtianity degenerate into inſipid, ſpiritleſs formality, when once it became contentious. It broke into parties, Sects multipli'd, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities grew high, and the grieved <hi>ſpirit of love</hi> retired from it! which is grieved by nothing more than by <hi>bitterneſs, wrath, anger,</hi> &amp;c. as the connexion of theſe two verſes intimates, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30, 31. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>It would oblige us to all acts of mutual kindneſs and friendſhip.</hi> If ſuch a love did govern in us, we ſhould be alwaies ready to <hi>ſerve one another in love,</hi> to bear each others burthens, to afford our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Counſel and help to one another, even in our private affairs if called thereto; eſpecially in that which is our common concern,

It would engage us to a free, amicable converſation with one another, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; would not let us do ſo abſurd a thing as to confine our Friendſhip to thoſe of our own Party, which we might as reaſonably, to men of our own ſtature, or to thoſe whoſe voice, and hair, and look and meen, were likeſt our own. It would make us not be aſhamed to be ſeen in each others Company, or be ſhy of owning one another. We ſhould not be to one another as <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> that had no dealing with one another, or as the <hi>Poet</hi> notes they were to other Nations; <hi>Non monstrare vias eadem niſi ſacra colenti,</hi> not ſo much as to ſhew the way to one <hi>not of their Religion.</hi> There would be no <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall</hi> thorough which <hi>love</hi> would not eaſily open a way of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commerce, by which we ſhould inſenſibly ſlide, more and more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one anothers hearts.

We ſhould believe one another in our mutual profeſſions, of whatſoever ſort, both of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to one another, and that we really doubt and ſcruple the things which we ſay we do.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This would hence make us earneſtly covet an entire <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in all the things wherein we differ and contribute greatly to it.</hi> We are too prone many times to diſlike <hi>things,</hi> for the diſliked <hi>Perſons</hi> ſake who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them.

            <p>And indeed when I have read the Pacific writings of <hi>thoſe eminent worthies,</hi> for the compoſing of thoſe differences abroad, I could not but wonder that the <hi>ſame peaceable Spirit</hi> did not endeavour <hi>with more effect</hi> the compoſing of our own much leſſer differences at home.

            <p>It is not for us to preſcribe (as was ſaid) to perſons that are <hi>now</hi> in ſo eminent ſtations as <hi>theſe</hi> were <hi>at that time.</hi> But may we not hope to find with ſuch (and where ſhould we rather expect to find it?) that compaſſion and mercifulneſs in imitation of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> their Lord and ours, as to conſider and ſtudy the neceſſities of Souls in theſe reſpects, and at leaſt, willingly to connive at, and very heartily approve ſome indulgences and abatements in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the inferiour Clergy, as They may not think fit themſelves poſitively to order and enjoyn? Otherwiſe I believe it could not but give ſome trouble to a conſcientious conforming Miniſter, if a ſober pious perſon, ſound in the Faith, and of a regular life ſhould tell him he is willing to uſe his Miniſtery, in ſome of the Ordinances of Chriſt, if only he would abate or deſpenſe with ſome annexed Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which in Conſcience he dare not uſe or admit of. I believe it would trouble ſuch a Miniſter to deal with a perſon of this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter as a <hi>Pagan</hi> becauſe of his ſcruple, and put him upon conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he ought not rather to dipenſe with <hi>mans rule,</hi> than with <hi>Gods.</hi> I know what the ſame Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> hath expreſly ſaid, that <q>He that believes the things contained in the Apoſtles Creed,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and endeavours to live a life agreeable to the precepts of Chriſt, ought not to be expung'd from the Roll of Chriſtians, nor be driven from Communion with the other Members of any Church whatſoever.</q>

And again, where this love remains, and bears rule, it can as little be that <hi>they who are unſatisfi'd with the way of worſhip that more generally obtains,</hi> ſhould cenſure them that are ſatisfi'd as inſincere, <hi>meerly becauſe of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi> It cannot permit that we ſhould think all the black thoughts we can invent of them, as if becauſe they have not our conſciences they had none, or becauſe they ſee not with our eyes they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both utterly, and wilfully blind. To be here more particular: The moſt you know are for the public way of Worſhip, and of theſe, ſome are for it as <hi>tolerable only,</hi> others <hi>as the beſt way,</hi> and think all other waies of worſhipping God in Aſſemblies (being forbidden as they think by a juſt Law) ſinful. Others, diſſenting, are of ſeveral ſorts. Some think <hi>the Conformity required of Miniſters</hi> ſinful, becauſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious terms required of them which they judge to be ſo, but <hi>not that which is required of the people.</hi> Of which ſort, ſome that think it not <hi>ſimply unlawful,</hi> find it however <hi>leſs edifying to them,</hi> and thô they can therefore partake in it at ſome times, think themſelves more ordinarily bound to attend ſuch <hi>other means</hi> as <hi>they find</hi> more conducing to their ſpiritual profit and advantage, judging they have an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right from Chriſt, anciently allowed from age to age in the beſt times of the Chriſtian Church, and never juſtly taken from them, of chooſing the Paſtors to whoſe ordinary care and conduct they ſhall commit their Souls. <hi>Others</hi> judge the public way <hi>ſimply unlawful,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42587:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> and therefore judge themſelves bound to decline it wholly; and are the more averſe to any participation in it, as apprehending it to have no ſuitableneſs or aptitude to profit their Souls, wherein they are the more confirmed that they believe not God will ever bleſs the means which he hath not appointed. Now how apt all theſe are unto very ſevere Cenſures of one another, he knowes not the age that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. One ſort cenſuring the other as humorſome, factious, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, the others them back again as formal, popiſhly affected, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of any ſavour of ſpiritual things, having nothing of God in them, or of the life and power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Now is this ſuitable to the love that ſhould rule among Chriſtians? or to the reverence we ought to have for that authority that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſuch judging? It ought to be conſidered both that all have not the <hi>ſame underſtanding,</hi> nor the ſame <hi>guſt and reliſh</hi> of things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not the ſame underſtanding.</hi> And therefore where <hi>Conſcience</hi> hath the ſame rule, it cannot have, with every one the ſame actual lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that rule being ſo very diverſly underſtood, which different eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Conſciences, the Apoſtle hath expreſs reference to in that large and moſt healing diſcourſe of his <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>One</hi> (ſaith he <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.) <hi>believeth that he may eat all things, another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</hi> Nor doth he, in reference to ſuch doubted things, determine what all ſhould do or not do, by <hi>particular rules,</hi> concerning every ſuch caſe that was then depending, which it ſeems he reckon'd was not neceſſary, or that might afterwards fall out, which was little to be expected. But he layes down <hi>one general rule,</hi> againſt <hi>judging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which he preſſes with that authority, and ſuch awful reaſons as might make a Chriſtian heart tremble to be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>And in reference to the mentioned differences among our ſelves (as well as others no nearer to the ſubſtantials and vitals of our Religion) there is ſomewhat elſe to be done than to conclude againſt a mans ſincerity becauſe of ſuch differing ſentiments and practices, and which certainly would be done, if truly Chriſtian love, or even juſtice it ſelf did take place as they ought, <hi>i. e.</hi> It would be conſidered what theſe ſeveral differing Parties have to ſay for themſelves, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they may alledge, and whether, thô they be not ſufficient to juſtifie their ſeveral opinions and practices (as all cannot be in the right) <hi>they be not ſuch as</hi> by which a conſcientious man, a ſincere fearer of God may be ſway'd, ſo as to take the way which he is found in by the ducture of an upright (thô miſguided) conſcience, and not as being under the government of depraved vicious inclination.</p>
            <p>As thoſe that can and do yield the conformity that is required of Miniſters, thô perhaps they wiſh ſome things altered, why may it not be ſuppoſed they ſincerely think (thô it ſhould be miſtakingly) that the things more liable to exception are capable of a ſenſe wherein they are not unlawful: And not being ſo, they think themſelves bound to take the opportunity which they this way obtain of doing good to the ſouls of men? Others alſo apprehending it lawful, how poſſible
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42587:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> is it to them from a certain reverence they have for Antiquity, and for our own firſt Reformers to think it beſt and fitteſt to be continued! Nor is it unſuppoſeable that many of the Layity may upon the ſame grounds have the ſame apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>divers in the Miniſtery</hi> judging the terms unlawful upon which only, they can have liberty for the public exerciſe of it: Is it not poſſible they may, with a ſincere conſcience, think themſelves not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged wholly to renounce their calling and office, to which they were duly ſet apart, and had by their own ſolemn vow given up themſelves; but to do ſo much of the work of it as they can have opportunity for?</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>of the People,</hi> ſome may think the public forms and wayes of worſhip <hi>not ſimply unlawful,</hi> but find them <hi>leſs edifying to them</hi> than other means which the Providence of God affords them; and therefore do more ordinarily attend thoſe, thô ſometimes alſo the other. Why ſhould it be thought on the one hand or the other that it is ſo little poſſible they ſhould be guided by reaſonable and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious conſiderations herein, that nothing but corrupt inclination muſt be underſtood to govern them? Is it not ſuppoſeable that accounting the public worſhip <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> agreeable to divine inſtitution, thô in ſome <hi>accidentals</hi> too diſagreeable, they may think there is more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them at ſome times, to attend it, than totally to diſown it? For what worſhip is there on earth that is in all things incorrupt? And they may apprehend it fit to teſtifie their union with the ſincere Chriſtians, that may be ſtatedly under that form, and eſpecially in a time when the conteſt is ſo high in the world, between them that profeſs the <hi>ſubſtance of Reformed Chriſtianity,</hi> and them that have ſo much deform'd it; and may conceive it becoming them (at any time) to expreſs their own unconfinedneſs to a Party, and to uſe that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>which (they think) ſhould not be jug'd by another mans Conſcience,</hi> which yet they would have regard to, where there are not greater reaſons to preponderate. They are indeed under a diſadvantage (with them that are apt to uſe a greater liberty in their Cenſures than they do in their practice in theſe matters) when it falls out that their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial compliance is the means of their ſecurity from penalties. And their diſadvantage is greater, whoſe judgment to this purpoſe hath not been formerly declared and made known. But they for ſhame ought to be ſilent whoſe total compliance gains them not only <hi>immunity,</hi> but <hi>great emoluments.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> perhaps, yielded not according to a former, but (at that time when the opportunity occurred) a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>altered</hi> judgment. <hi>They</hi> may however know themſelves to be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by greater ends than ſecular intereſt. And ſo may <hi>theſe</hi> we now ſpeak of, and yet may think the preſervation of their earthly porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith they are to glorifie God in this world not too little an end to be deſigned and endeavoured by lawful means. It were a very uncouth and ſinful thing to do a ſpiritual action for a carnal end. But if the thing ſincerely and ſupreamly deſigned, be the glory
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42587:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God, <hi>that</hi> is the moſt <hi>ſpiritual end.</hi> If it be not, <hi>that</hi> ought to be chang'd which is wrong, not that which is right. The unlawful end, not the lawful action, if it be lawful. If it be not, their good end will not juſtify their action, but it will their ſincerity, which is all that this diſcourſe intends.</p>
            <p>And then for <hi>ſuch as decline the public Worſhip totally,</hi> as judging it <hi>ſimply unlawful:</hi> Is it not poſſible they may be led to that Practice by ſomewhat elſe than humour and factious inclination? Have they not that to ſay, which may at leaſt <hi>ſeem</hi> ſolid and ſtrong to a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man? How jealous God did heretofore ſhew himſelf in all the affairs of his Worſhip! How particular in the appointment even of the ſmalleſt things he would have appertain to it! How unſuitable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd Ceremonies are to the mature State of the Church! And how ſenſibly burdenſome, they were to the Diſciples of the firſt Age <hi>as a yoke not to be born.</hi> And that therefore <hi>God himſelf</hi> when the ſeaſon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and the fulnes of time came, thought fit to abrogate thoſe of his own former appointment, with no (probable) deſign to allow <hi>men</hi> the liberty of ſubſtituting others in their room. Why is it not to be thought that the fear of the great God withholds them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they judge would offend him? And that, if they erre, it is for fear of erring? Why can nothing be thought on whereto to impute their practice, but peeviſh humour?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if that be conſidered (which is common to theſe two laſt mentioned ſorts of men) that they ſenſibly find other means more edifying to them, or expect <hi>them only</hi> to be ſo, if the other be thought unlawful. If they be thought <hi>meerly lawful,</hi> and ſuch as may therefore be uſed upon weighty reaſons <hi>at ſome times,</hi> but are found <hi>leſs edifying,</hi> who can doubt but I ought to uſe for my Soul (at leaſt in an ordinary courſe) the apteſt means that I can ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have for the promoting its edification and ſalvation? Do we not reckon our ſelves to owe ſo much even to our bodies? And what is <hi>another mans opinion</hi> to ſignifie againſt <hi>my ſenſe</hi> and conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience? Is there not ſuch a thing as a mental <hi>idioſyneraſie</hi> (or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of temper) as well as a bodily? and whereto what is moſt agreeable, any man that is not deſtitute of ordinary underſtanding is the fitteſt judge himſelf. As every one, that is not a <hi>meer fool,</hi> is ſo much a <hi>Phyſician</hi> as to know what diet ſutes him beſt.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſaid againſt the former of theſe two ſorts, <hi>Are they n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t at all times obliged to uſe the means which are most edifying?</hi> They may ſay at all times when they have nothing to outweigh their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent edification. But it is not impoſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible that a conſciencious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may eſteem all the forementioned conſiderations concurring, to be of more weight than the greater advantage hoped to be gained in that one hour. Nor need any man be aſhamed profeſſedly to avow that which may ſeem the leaſt of them, <hi>the ſaving of himſelf from temporal ruine.</hi> For he is to be accountable to God for what portion he hath intruſted him with of the good things of this life,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42587:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> and is not to throw it away without ſufficient cauſe. Who ſees not that more is allowed and ordinarily done without ſcruple or cenſure upon the like account? as to omit the hearing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, if at that time ones houſe be on fire, yea or if it be to ſave my Neighbours, or the plucking of an Ox or Sheep out of a ditch on the Lords day, when I might have been employ'd at that time in the ſolemn worſhip of God to my Spiritual advantage. <hi>A meer commutation</hi> unto leſs advantage upon an equally or more urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is leſs than <hi>omiſſion.</hi> And they that ſhall <hi>have learned,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> directs, <hi>what that means, I will have mercy and not Sacrifice, will not condemn the guiltleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only ſuch are concerned firſt to ſearch well and be ſatisfy'd concerning the <hi>lawfulneſs of their action in it ſelf,</hi> that they do it not with a ſelf-condemning conſcience, nor with a groundleſly ſelf-juſtifying one. And then eſpecially to ſee to it that <hi>their end be right. Gods intereſt</hi> not <hi>their own,</hi> otherwiſe than in a due, entire ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his. We can never act innocently or comfortably in any thing, till he be in every thing more abſolutely <hi>our all in all;</hi> and have much more reaſon to be ſcrupulous, and (if others knew our hearts) were much more liable to cenſure, that, in our common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he is ſo much forgotten, that we live not more entirely to him; which we little animadvert upon, and are very officious to <hi>caſt motes out of our brothers eye, when this beam is in our own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſign of mentioning theſe hints of reaſons for ſo different judgments and practices, is not to ſhew which are ſtrongeſt, and ought to prevail, which cannot be the buſineſs of ſo ſhort a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as this, and ſo much of another nature, but to ſhew that while there is any thing colourable to be alledg'd for this or that way, True Chriſtian love, compaſſion of <hi>common humane frailty,</hi> and a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble ſenſe <hi>of a mans own,</hi> would oblige him to think that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God</hi> may have a greater hand (thô with ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided <hi>it ſelf</hi>) in guiding men the different waies they take, than is commonly thought. And to conſider thô ſuch and ſuch reaſons ſeem not weighty <hi>to me,</hi> they may to ſome others, who are as much afraid of ſinning againſt God as I; and, perhaps, their underſtandings as good in other matters as mine. It would be conſidered how really difficult the <hi>controverſie</hi> is <hi>about the ceremonies,</hi> and ſome other parts of conformity. Perhaps few <hi>metaphyſical queſtions</hi> are diſputed with more ſubtilty than that controverſie is managed with, by Arch-biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Burgeſſe,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ames, Cartwright, Calverwood</hi> and <hi>others.</hi> And how very eaſily poſſible and pardonable is it to unlearned perſons, or of weaker intellectuals, being obliged in order to their practice to give a judgment in reference to theſe things one way or other, to judge amiſs! Why ſhould we expect every ſincerely pious man to be able to hit the very point of truth and right in matters <hi>that belong,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> once ſaid in another caſe <hi>[non ad fidem fundamentalem, ſed ad peritiam Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42587:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> &amp; fortaſſe ne ad hanc quidem, ſed aliquando ad curioſitatem Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logorum,] not to the foundation of our Faith, but to the skill of Divines, and perhaps not to this neither, but ſometimes only to their curioſity.</hi> What were to be done in reference to ſo nicely diſputable things made part of the terms of Chriſtian communion, is more the matter of our wiſh than hope, till by a gracious influence God better mens minds, or by a more deeply felt neceſſity bring us to underſtand what is to be done. Our caſe is ill when only <hi>vexatio dat intellectum,</hi> when <hi>nothing but ſorrow and ſuffering will make us wiſe</hi> which is very likely from the righteous hand of God to be our common lot.</p>
            <p>In the mean time 'tis hard to think that he cannot be a ſincerely pious man whoſe underſtanding is not capable of ſo difficult things, as to make a certainly right judgment about them: <hi>In abſoluto &amp; facili ſtat eternitas.</hi> And why ſhould not the communion of perſons going into a bleſſed eternity have the ſame meaſure?</p>
            <p>And beſides the different ſize, and capacity of mens underſtandings, and conſequently of their conſcientious determinations,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are alſo as differing <hi>reliſhes</hi> of theſe things, which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love</hi> would oblige a man to conſider with equanimity, ſo as thereupon to refrain hard cenſures. All good men have not the ſame reliſh of the various forms and modes of diſpenſing the Truths and Ordinances of Chriſt. Some of our ſuffering Brethren in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes are ſaid to have found great ſpiritual refreſhing by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer. And in our own dayes ſome may profeſs to have their hearts warm'd, their affections rais'd and elevated by it. They are no rule to us; but it would leſs become us, hereupon to ſuſpect their ſincerity, than our own. Others again cannot reliſh ſuch modes of worſhip, when in the Miniſtry of ſuch as uſe them not, they find a very ſenſible delight and ſavour.</p>
            <p>And this, by the way, ſhews the great difference between ſuch things as have their evidence and goodneſs from God himſelf, and thoſe that borrow their recommendableneſs only from humane device. All good men in all the times and ages of the Chriſtian Church have a conſtant value and love for the great ſubſtantials of Religion, which have in them that inward evidence and excellency as commands and captivates a rectifi'd mind and heart, whereas the meer external forms of it, the outward dreſs and garb, are variouſly eſteem'd and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, liked and diſliked by the <hi>ſame ſort of men, i. e.</hi> by very ſincere lovers of God, not only in divers times and ages, but even in the ſame time. How different hath the eſteem been of the <hi>Liturgick forms</hi> with them who bear the ſame mind, full of reverence and love towards Religion it ſelf! As that <hi>habit</hi> is thought decent at one time, which in another is deſpicably ridiculous; whereas a perſon in himſelf come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graceful, is alwaies accounted ſo, by all, and at all times.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>various guſt and reliſh</hi> cannot but have influence, more remotely, upon the <hi>conſcientious determination of our choice,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42587:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> our uſual way of worſhipping God. For how ſhould I edifie by what is diſguſtful to me? Thô it be true that our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al edification lies more in the informing of our judgments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming our reſolutions, than in the guſts and reliſhes of affection, yet who ſees not that <hi>theſe</hi> are of great uſe <hi>even to the other?</hi> And that it is neceſſary that at leaſt there be not a diſguſt or antipathy? What is <hi>conſtantly</hi> leſs grateful, will certainly be leſs nutritive. <hi>That</hi> is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>neceſſary</hi> to nouriſhment. Thô, alone, it be not <hi>ſufficient.</hi> As it is in the matter of bodily repaſts. Who can without great prejudice be bound to eat alwayes of a food that he diſreliſhes, though he may, without much inconvenience, for a valuable reaſon, do it at ſome time.</p>
            <p>And they that think all this alledged difference is but fancy, ſhew they underſtand little of humane nature, and leſs of Religion: Thô they may have <hi>that</hi> in themſelves too which they do not ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect upon, even that peculiar guſt and reliſh, which they make ſo little account of. For have they not as great a diſguſt of the <hi>others</hi> way, as <hi>they</hi> have of theirs? would They not as much regret to be <hi>ty'd</hi> to theirs? Have they not as great a liking of their own? And doth not common experience ſhew that there are as different <hi>mental reliſhes</hi> as bodily? How comes one man in the <hi>matters of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to ſavour <hi>Metaphyſicks?</hi> another <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> another <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and the like? and no mans <hi>Genius</hi> can be forc't in theſe things. Why may there not be the like difference in the <hi>matters of Religion?</hi> And I would fain know what that Religion is worth that is without a guſt and ſavour, that is inſipid and unpleaſant, much more that would, being uſed in a conſtant courſe, this or that way, be nauſeous and offenſive?</p>
            <p>If indeed men nauſeate that which is neceſſary for them, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for inſtance, or Religion it ſelf, that is certainly ſuch a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as if the grace of God overcome it not, will be mortal to them, and we are not to think of relieving them, by withdrawing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending object, which it ſelf muſt be the means of their cure. But is there any parity between the ſubſtance of Religion, which is of Gods appointing, and the ſuperadded modes of it, that are of our own?</p>
            <p>Upon the whole nothing is more agreeable, either to this divine principle of Love, nothing (within our compaſs) more conducible to our end, the ceaſing of our differences (which are moſt likely to die and vaniſh by neglect) or their ceaſing to be inconvenient to us, than to bear calm and placid minds towards one another under them, to baniſh all hard thoughts becauſe of them. If I can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute no way elſe to union, from this holy dictate and law of the Spirit of love, I can at leaſt abſtain from cenſuring my fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. It is the eaſieſt thing in the world one would think <hi>not to do;</hi> Eſpecially not to do a thing of it ſelf ungrateful to a well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd mind; and a great priviledge not to be obliged to judge another
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42587:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> mans conſcience and practice, when it is ſo eaſie to misjudge and do wrong. Moſt of all when the matter wherein I preſume to fit in judgment upon another is of ſo high a nature, as the poſture of his heart God-ward. A matter peculiarly belonging to another Tribunal, of divine cognizance, and which we all confeſs to be only known to God himſelf. And if I would take upon me to conclude a man inſincere, and an hypocrite, only becauſe he is not of my mind in theſe ſmaller things that are controverted among us, how would I form my argument? <hi>No one can with ſincerity differ from that man whoſe underſtanding is ſo good and clear as to apprehend all things with abſolute certainty juſt as they are.</hi> And then go on to aſſume (and a ſtrange aſſuming it muſt be) <hi>But my underſtanding is ſo good and clear as,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis hard to ſay whether the <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> of the <hi>one aſſertion,</hi> or the <hi>arrogance</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> is greater; and whether <hi>both</hi> be more <hi>immoral</hi> or <hi>abſurd.</hi> But the <hi>impiety</hi> is worſt of all, for how inſolently doth ſuch a man take upon him to make a new Goſpel! and other terms of ſalvation than God hath made! when <hi>his</hi> ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and determinations of things which God hath never made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſary, muſt be the meaſure and rule of life and death to men! How is the throne and judicial power of the <hi>Redeemer</hi> uſurp't which he hath founded in his blood. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth. Yea, he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi> verſe 9. <hi>For to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> verſe 10. <hi>But why doſt thou judge thy brother? or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> verſe 11. <hi>For it is written, As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God.</hi> One would think they that lay no reſtraint upon themſelves in this matter of judging their brethren, upon every light occaſion, reckon this chapter came by chance into the Bible. And that our Lord ſpake himſelf, at random, words that had no meaning, when he ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Judge not that you be not judged,</hi> &amp;c. What man that fears God would not dread to be the framer of a new Goſpel, and of new terms of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is a great ſolace indeed to a ſincere mind; but implies a ſevere rebuke, in the mean time, to ſuch a ſelf-aſſuming cenſorious ſpirit, that it may in ſuch a caſe be ſo truly ſaid, <hi>It is a much eaſier thing to pleaſe God than man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that find this meaſure will have the better of it, if they can abſtain from retaliating, when as the reaſon of it is the ſame on both ſides. For they may ſay, <hi>You are to remember I differ no more from you in this matter, than you do from me, and if I judge not you about it, what greater reaſon have you to judge me?</hi> And they have little reaſon to value ſuch a mans judgment concerning their duty in a doubtful matter, who cannot ſee his own in ſo plain a caſe. The matter for which they judge me may be very doubtful, but nothing can be plainer than that they ought not ſo to judge.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:42587:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>9. <hi>A due Chriſtian love would oblige us after competent endeavours of mutual ſatisfaction about the matters wherein we differ to forbear further urging of one another concerning them.</hi> Which urging may be two wayes.

            </p>
            <p>Some perhaps find it more ſutable to their own temper, and meaſure of underſtanding and conſcience, to go the former way; and only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently perſwade to <hi>do the thing</hi> wherein the other ſhall comply with them, and in ſome fort juſtifie the courſe which <hi>they</hi> have taken. Without regard to the others conſcience; preſs them right or wrong to fall in with them. Sometimes labouring to work upon their <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> by <hi>flattery,</hi> ſometimes upon their <hi>fear</hi> by <hi>threats and menaces.</hi> Sincere love would certainly abhor to do thus. Would it let me violate anothers conſcience any way? The love I bear to a fellow-Chriſtian, if it be true, having for its meaſure <hi>that wherewith I love my ſelf,</hi> would no more let me do it than hurt the apple of mine own eye. An inſpirited waking conſcience is as tender a thing, and capable of a worſe ſort of hurt. <hi>If ſome have more latitude</hi> than I, and think what they <hi>may do, in preſent circumſtances</hi> ſo far as they may, <hi>they muſt,</hi> would it not be the <hi>dictate of love</hi> patiently to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, eſpecially when it comes to ſuffering. For let me put my own ſoul in his ſouls ſtead, and would I be willing to ſuffer upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans conſcience, and not upon my own? and forfeit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations which in a ſuffering condition belong to them <hi>who for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God endure grief,</hi> would I, if I lov'd them, be content they had the grief and did want the conſolation? There will be ſtill found <hi>in a ſtate of ſuffering,</hi> ſomewhat that will prove a common cauſe to good men wherein they will moſt entirely agree, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſmaller things they may differ in. As the pious Biſhops <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> well agreed upon a Martyrdom at the Stake, in the ſame important Cauſe, who before, had differed (ſomewhat angrily) about ſome Ceremonies. Concerning which difference how pathetical is the Letter<note n="†" place="margin">Fox. Martyr.</note> of the former of theſe to the other, when both were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners (the one at <hi>Oxford</hi> the other at <hi>London</hi>) on the ſame account. <hi>But now, my dear brother</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>foraſmuch as we throughly agree and wholly conſent together in thoſe things which are the grounds, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial points of our Religion; againſt the which the World ſo furiouſly rageth in theſe our dayes, howſoever, in time paſt, by certain by Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and circumstances of Religion, your wiſdom, and my ſimplicity</hi> (I grant) <hi>have a little jarred; each of us following the abundance of his own ſenſe and judgment, Now, I ſay, be you aſſured, that even with my whole heart, God is my witneſs, in the bowels of Christ, I love you in the truth, and for the truth's ſake, which abideth in us, and as I am perſwaded ſhall, by the grace of God, abide in us for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>if others have leſs latitude.</hi> It would be far from us to add to the affliction they are liable to, upon that very account, by a vexatious urging and importuning them. Eſpecially to do it with inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42587:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> threats, and menaces, and labour to overawe their brethren, againſt their conſciences, into the embracing of their ſentiments and way. Is it poſſible a Chriſtian ſhould not underſtand how neceſſary it is to every ones duty and peace that he exactly follow that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Apoſtles, and eſteem it moſt ſacred. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> And that we firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to do any thing with regret or a miſgiving heart, at leaſt. Not againſt a prevailing doubt, for in very doubtful caſes to be rid of all <hi>formido oppoſiti</hi> or <hi>ſuſpicion that the matter may be otherwiſe</hi> is perhaps impoſſible to me, but to do any thing againſt the prepondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inclination of my judgment and conſcience, were great wickedneſs, and ſuch as, if it were known, would make me unfit for any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whatſoever. And I do here appeal to you who moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame any of us for our diſſent from you, whether if we ſhould thus declare to you, <q>That 'tis truly againſt our conſciences to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with you upon your terms, we believe we ſhould great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend God in it, and draw upon us his diſpleaſure, but yet to pleaſe you, and prevent our temporal inconvenience, or ruine, we will do it.</q> I appeal to you, I ſay, whether we ſhould not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make our ſelves uncapable of any Chriſtian communion with you or any others? This is then the plain State of the caſe, and you do even put theſe words into our mouths: <q>If we follow the dictate of our conſciences we muſt decline you; if we go againſt it, you muſt decline us; ſuppoſing we declare it, if we dclare it not, we have nothing to qualify us for your communion but hypocriſy and diſſimulation! And what do you gain by ſuch an acceſſion to the Church? you have gained, in any ſuch caſe, not half the man, the outſide, the carkaſs only, or the ſhadow of the man, <hi>i. e.</hi> when you have debaucht our conſciences, when you have ſpoil'd us, and made us worth nothing, then we are yours, wherein you ſhew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of love either to us or to your ſelves!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others again that are, themſelves, men of more <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> take the ſomewhat more <hi>manly</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> courſe; and bend themſelves by argument to convince the reaſon, and ſatisfy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of ſuch as differ from them. But herein alſo there may be an exceſſe, that is, unprofitable, and grievous to thoſe they would work upon by this courſe. And from which therefore <hi>Chriſtian love,</hi> ſtudying the peace and quiet of their brethren would reſtrain them. I ſay from the <hi>ungrateful exceſſe of ſuch an endeavour.</hi> For I would fain know can there not <hi>herein</hi> be an exceſſe? Is it not ſuppoſeable that they who differ from me, in ſuch leſſer things, may be <hi>ſometime</hi> arrived to a ſettlement and fixedneſs of judgment in them, as well as I? Is it not poſſible they have weighed the moments of things as much as I have done? Is ſuch a cauſe infinite? Is it not poſſible that all may have been ſaid in it which is to be ſaid, and the matter have been ſifted to the very bran? So that all my further arguings may ſerve but to argue my vain <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi> or aboundingneſs in my

Or what if they ſerve at length, but to ſhew the incapacity of the ſubject to be wrought upon, and the different complexion of his mind I am treating with. All cannot receive all things. We cannot make our ſentiments en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with every one. Perhaps they ſhew the weakneſs of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: And then hath that direction of the Apoſtle no Authority with us. <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive, but not to doubtful diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> Rom. 14.1.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>What it is,</hi> or <hi>what meaſure and degree of it,</hi> that would be of ſo great uſe in ſuch a caſe.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Our underſtandings are duly enlightned</hi> ſo as mentally to entertain aright the doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1. <hi>Diſtinctly to apprehend</hi> the <hi>meaning</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of this myſterious revelation of God in Chriſt. 2. <hi>And to be fully aſſured</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of it.</p>

And of how vaſt importance this is towards our eſtabliſhment, the confirming, fortifying and uniting of our hearts, and our joynt preſervation in our <hi>Chriſtian ſtate</hi> (the main thing we are to deſign, and be ſolicitous for) we may ſee in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby we ſhould apprehend the things to be truly great wherein we are to unite.</hi> That union is not like to be firm and laſting, the center whereof is a <hi>trifle.</hi> It muſt be ſomewhat that is <hi>of it ſelf</hi> apt to attract and hold our hearts ſtrongly to it.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>More grateful to God,</hi> who is not pleaſed with the ſtench of Carkaſſes, or with the <hi>dead ſhewes</hi> of Religion inſtead of the <hi>living ſubſtance.</hi> We ſhould hereupon not be deſerted of the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which we cannot but reckon will retire when we entertain him but with inſipid formalities. What became of the Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the world, when Chriſtians had ſo ſenſibly diverted from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42587:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> minding the great things of Religion to little minute circumſtances, about which they affected to buſie themſelves, or to the purſuit of worldly advantages and delights?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>More awful to men;</hi> They who are tempted to deſpiſe the faint languid appearances of an impotent, inefficacious, ſpiritleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, diſcern a Majeſty in that which is viſibly living, powerful, and productive of ſuitable fruits. Who that ſhall conſider the ſtate af the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and the gradual declining of <hi>Religion</hi> for that three hundred years from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time to that of <hi>Phocas,</hi> but ſhall ſee cauſe at once to lament the ſin and folly of men, and adore the righteous ſeverity of God? For as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> grew gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to be looſe, wanton, ſenſual, and their <hi>leaders</hi> contentious, luxurious, covetous, proud, ambitious, affecters of Domination, ſo was the Chriſtian Church gradually forſaken of the divine preſence. Inaſmuch as that at the ſame time when <hi>Boniface</hi> obtained from <hi>Phocas</hi> the title of univerſal Biſhop, in defiance of the ſevere ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Predeceſſor <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, ſprang up the dreadful deluſion of <hi>Mahomet</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Hereby we ſhall be inabled moſt reſolvedly to ſuffer being call'd to it,</hi> when it is for the great things of the Goſpel, <hi>the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> clearly and with aſſurance underſtood and acknowledg'd. Such a faith will not be without its pleaſant reliſhes. 'Tis an uncomfortable thing to ſuffer either for the <hi>meer ſpiritleſs, uncertain, unoperative notions and opinions,</hi> or for <hi>the unenlivened out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms of Religion,</hi> that we never felt to do us good, in which we never taſted ſweetneſs, or felt power, that we were really no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ever the better for. But who will heſitate at ſuffering for ſo great things as the ſubſtantials of the Goſpel, which he hath <hi>clearly underſtood,</hi> whereof he is <hi>fully aſſured,</hi> and which he hath <hi>practically acknowledged,</hi> and embraced, ſo as to feel the energy and power of them, and reliſh their delicious ſweetneſs in his ſoul! And thô by ſuch ſuffering he himſelf periſh from off this earth, his Religion lives, is ſpread the more in the preſent age, and propagated to after ages. So ſeminal and fruitful a thing is the blood of Martyrs! as hath alwaies been obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>And as ſuch a faith of the Myſtery of the Goſpel appears to have this tendency to the beſt, firmeſt, and moſt laſting union among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (and the conſequent preſervation of the Chriſtian Intereſt) <hi>this mystery being more generally conſidered only;</hi> So this tendency of it would be more diſtinctly ſeen, if we ſhould conſider the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and remarkable parts of it. <hi>The mystery of the Redeemers perſon.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:42587:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> The <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God uniting himſelf with the nature of man. <hi>His Office.</hi> A reconciler of God and Man to each other. <hi>His Death,</hi> as a propitiatory ſacrifice <hi>to ſlay all enmity. His victory</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over it, wherein is founded his <hi>univerſal Empire</hi> over all. <hi>His triumphant entrance into Heaven,</hi> whither he is to collect all that ever lov'd, truſted and obey'd him, to dwell and be converſant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his eternal love and praiſes. How directly do all theſe tend to endear and bind the hearts and ſouls of Chriſtians to God, and him, and one another in everlaſting bonds!</p>
            <p>Thus then we have the <hi>anſwer</hi> to our <hi>question</hi> in the two parts of the Text. The former pointing out to us the <hi>ſubjects of our union,</hi> with the <hi>uniting principle</hi> by which they are to be combin'd with one another.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>We have great cauſe to lament their decay;</hi> for how viſible is it! and how deſtructive to the common truly Chriſtian Intereſt!

Our Lord himſelf gave it them to be their diſtinguiſhing character. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples if you love one another.</hi> Good Lord! what are they now to be known by!</p>
            <p>And what a cloudy, wavering, uncertain, lank, ſpiritleſs thing is <hi>the Faith of Christians</hi> in this age become! How little are the aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining grounds of it underſtood, or endeavoured to be underſtood! <hi>Most</hi> content themſelves to profeſs it only as the Religion of their Countrey, and which was delivered to them by their forefathers.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us endeavour the revival of theſe principles.</hi> This is that in reference whereto we need <hi>no humane laws.</hi> We need not <hi>Edicts of Princes</hi> to be our warrant for this practice, loving one another, and cleaving with a more grounded lively Faith to God and his Chriſt. Here is no place for ſcruple of Conſcience in this matter. And as to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42587:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> this <hi>mutual love:</hi> What if others will not do their parts to make it ſo?

            <p>And let us endeavour the more <hi>thorough deep radication</hi> of <hi>our faith,</hi> that it may be more lively and fruitful: which this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> you ſee (not forgetting his <hi>ſcope</hi> and aim) further preſſes in the following verſes, teſtifying his <hi>joy</hi> for what he underſtood there was of it among theſe Chriſtians. <hi>Thô I be abſent in the fleſh, yet I am with you in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, joying and beholding your order, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of your faith in Chriſt.</hi> verſ. 5.

            <p>And what alſo, muſt we ſuſpend the exerciſe and improvement of <hi>our Faith in the great Myſteries of the Goſpel,</hi> till all others will agree upon the ſame thing! Let us do our own part, ſo as we may be able to ſay, <q>
                  <hi>Per me non stetit,</hi> it was not my fault, but Chriſtians had been combined, and entirely one with each other, but they had been more thoroughly Chriſtian, and more entirely united with God in Chriſt, that Chriſtianity had been a more lively, powerful, awful, amiable thing.

            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Manner</hi> how this Duty of Mourning for the Sins of others <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> is to be performed. This I ſhall conſider in three branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How we ſhould mourn in reſpect of <hi>God</hi> before whom we mourn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How we ſhould mourn in reſpect of the <hi>Wicked</hi> for whom we mourn.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How we ſhould mourn in reſpect of <hi>our ſelves</hi> who are the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt Branch, as our Mourning reſpects <hi>God:</hi> It is to be performed with advancing of thoſe <hi>perfections</hi> of his that relate to thoſe great Sins and Sinners for which and for whom we mourn. And in our mourning for the Sins of others in reſpect of God, we muſt advance</p>
            <p n="1">1. His great and unparallel'd <hi>Patience</hi> and Long-ſuffering extended towards thoſe whoſe Sins we mourn and lament over. This was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s confeſſing and bewailing the ſins of the ſinful <hi>Jewes, Nehem.</hi> 9.30. At large he confeſſeth their ſins in that Chapter, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 30, 31. he addes the admiration and acknowledgment of Gods forbearing goodneſs towards them. <hi>Yet</hi> (ſaith he <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.) <hi>didſt thou forbear them,</hi> or as 'tis in the Hebrew, protract, defer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Memuſbeka,</hi> Ezek. 12.15.</note> prolong over them; <hi>yea many years didſt thou forbear them;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in their Enemies hands, for their ſins, yet <hi>nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for thy great mercies ſake thou didſt not utterly conſume nor forſake them.</hi> When we mourn for the ſins of our Places, we ſhould much admire Gods forbearing Goodneſs, that he defers to puniſh thoſe Sins and Sinners which we muſt not defer to mourn for. We ſhould lay Man low, but at the ſame time ſet up God <hi>high,</hi> and in nothing more than in his Patience towards Sinners: <hi>Patience</hi> I ſay infinitely exceeding any ever exerciſed by Man. 1. All the Sins we mourn for, are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42587:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt clearly <hi>ſeen</hi> by God and known to him. He ſees ſin wherever 'tis, and infinitely more plainly underſtands, all the odious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and aggravations of ſin, than we can do that mourn for them, or than they can that did commit them. And 2. As he ſees ſin in all its odiouſneſs, ſo he infinitely more <hi>hates</hi> it than all the Saints and Angels in Heaven can do, as being the only object of his <hi>hatred,</hi> all the Streams whereof are collected in this one Channel. Sin being alſo againſt his very nature and <hi>being,</hi> a deſtroying him in the deſire of the Sinner, and that which ſhould he in the leaſt meaſure love, or leſs than infinitely hate, he would ceaſe to be God. Further admire his Patience 3. In ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe that are perfectly in his power to deſtroy, Rebels that are under his feet: Yea, laſtly, whom in all their Rebellions, he invites to repentance, yea feeds, ſupplies, maintains daily and richly. Say then in thy Mourning for the Abominations of others, How patient art thou in forbearing to puniſh thoſe ſins, which it is my duty with an holy impatience to ſee and hear!</p>
            <p n="2">2. In mourning for the ſins of the Wicked, advance God in the acknowledgment of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs, ſhould he with utmoſt ſeverity take vengeance upon Offenders. This we ſhall find alſo to be the temper of holy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the forementioned Chapter the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe, where mourning for the ſins of the People, he clears and acquits God from any injuſtice in executing his heavyeſt ſeverities upon ſinners.<note place="margin">So Ezra 9.15. Pſal. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Howbeit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, for thou haſt done right, but we have done wickedly.</hi> Say, Lord, I wonder not at the evils that doe, but thoſe that do not befall us: Were the fire of thy wrath proportion'd to the fewel of our ſins, we ſhould be utterly conſumed. 'Tis <hi>thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> Lord we are not ſo; Thou wouldſt be infinitely juſt and to be juſtifi'd if we were ſo.</p>
            <p>And 3. In ſpreading before God the wickedneſſes of great Sinners, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his infinite <hi>Power,</hi> that can not only ſtop the worſt of men in, but turn them from their courſe of oppoſing God by their Rebellions. We are not ſo to mourn for, as to deſpair of the Converſion of the worſt. They are as much within the <hi>Converting</hi> reach, as the <hi>Destructive</hi> reach of Gods hand. Say, 1. This great Sinner whoſe Impieties I bewail, can eaſily by thy irreſiſtible Grace, which no hard heart can reject, (as was <hi>Saul</hi>) be made not only of a Wolf, a Sheep, but even a Shepherd too. I cenſure his <hi>way,</hi> but I dare not determ ine his <hi>end.</hi> Thou haſt made white Paper of as black and filthy dunghil raggs. What cannot the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power of God accompliſh for the Converſion of the greateſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? I now bewail him Lord, but thou canſt alſo make him more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail himſelf, and make him as zealous in ſetting up, as now he is in deſtroying thy People. It ſhould more comfort thee that thou ſinneſt not with them, than trouble thee that thou ſuffereſt from them. God can make ſtrait timber of a crooked piece. God can take his Garden out of Satan's Waſte. Oh! how glorious would pardoning Grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Power appear in cauſing ſuch a change!</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42587:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. In mourning admire that Grace and Power that hath kept thee from their Exceſſes and Extravagancies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Branch of the Manner how we muſt bewail the Sins <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> of others, is as it reſpects thoſe for whom, and for whoſe Sins we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn. You may take up this in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt bewail the Sins of our <hi>bittereſt Enemies,</hi> as well as of our moſt beloved <hi>Relations.</hi> A rare and ſeldom practiſed duty I fear that this will be found. I ſuppoſe there's no godly man but bitterly mourns for the Impieties of his dear Yoke-fellow, or Child, but to mourn becauſe a cruel Enemy either diſhonours God, or damns his own Soul, I doubt there are very few that are conſcientious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Nothing is more common than to rail at our Enemies for their Impieties, and to expoſe them to Obloquy, and publick Hatred; but I fear there's nothing more unuſual than to bewail their Soul, their ſelf-deſtroying Sins before God in ſecret. The former, <hi>Pride,</hi> and Self-love, will eaſily put us upon; the latter only flows from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, and holy ſanctified Zeal and Compaſſion.<note place="margin">Jer. 13.17.</note> To embrace the former, and neglect the latter, is to exchange a Duty for a Sin. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable exchange! The holy temper of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19.41.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> acted by his Spirit, diſcovered their bewailings and ſhedding tears for thoſe that deſired to ſhed their blood. Doubtleſs ſuch a mourning as this, would, if not prevail for the Converſion of Enemies, yet be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable evidence to our Conſciences of the truth, yea the ſtrength of Grace in us, and of pardoning Grace beſtow'd upon us, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high a degree of forgiving our Enemies. 'Tis a thouſand times more eligible that mine Enemies Sins ſhould ſuffer Shipwrack in a Sea of my tears, than their Perſons ſhould be born down by the ſtream of my Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to bewail the Sins of our near and dear <hi>Relations,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> in a greater meaſure than thoſe of meer Strangers. Natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſanctified is the ſtrongeſt. As Nature puts forth it ſelf to neareſt Relations in ſtrong affection, ſo Grace engageth to a proportionable degree of ſpiritualizing that Affection. How earneſt and deſirous was holy <hi>Paul</hi> for his <hi>Kinſmen in the fleſh,</hi> that <hi>they ſhould be ſaved!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.1.</note> Never did a godly man in the World, never durſt he neglect the Duty of bewailing the Sins of his Children. <hi>Job</hi> offered Sacrifices,<note place="margin">Job 1.5.</note> and Prayers, and Tears too (no doubt) for very fear his Children might offend God. There is in the Saints a ſpiritual <hi>Storge,</hi> a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection Spiritualized: No Godly man knows how to ſpare any one Child of his for the Devil: it muſt needs trouble him to fear that they who are ſo near in this, ſhould be ſo diſtant in the <hi>next</hi> Life. His Soul deſires eſpeciaſly Soul-mercies for his Children. To ſee them poor in the World, will not ſo much afflict him as to fear they will never be <hi>rich to God.</hi> Beſides the Sins of thoſe that are nearly related, are moſt frequently preſented to our eyes and ears;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42587:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> they cry neareſt us, and therefore they ſhould cry loudeſt to us: They are moſt committed to our care, and therefore their miſcarriages ſhould be the greateſt objects of our <hi>Fear.</hi> Near Relations may alſo probably more endanger the reſidue of thoſe that belong to our Family. Sin in one or two, though in a large Family, may endanger and infect the whole. We moſt ſtrive to quench thoſe Flames that deſtroy houſes near us, we are more fearful of them, than of thoſe at a greater diſtance: A Snake in ones <hi>Bed</hi> is more formidable, and a Toad <hi>there</hi> more odious and ugly, than in my <hi>Field</hi> or <hi>Garden.</hi>
            </p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> 3. They that mourn for others Sins, eſpecially the Sins of thoſe they moſt love, muſt mourn more for <hi>their Sins,</hi> than their <hi>Afflictions and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Troubles.</hi> They muſt be more troubled for the poyſonful root of Sin, than for the Branches and Fruits of Sufferings that ſpring from the Root. We muſt more mourn for the <hi>ſin</hi> of a Child, than for the <hi>ſickneſs</hi> of a Child. More lay to heart what our Children have <hi>done,</hi> than what they have <hi>undergone:</hi> more for their Impiety, than for their Poverty: more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have left God, than becauſe their Trades or Eſtates have left them: more for fear they dy'd in Sin, than becauſe they dy'd. The Troubles of the outward man muſt not ſo afflict us, as the Unrenewedneſs of their Hearts and Natures. To be afflicted for the death of thy Child's Body, and not for his Soul-death in Sin, is as if a fond Parent, ſhould when his Child is drown'd, only lament the loſs of the Child's Coat and Garment, and not for the loſs of the Child's Perſon.</p>

We muſt endeavour to follow the Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sinners with <hi>reſtraining</hi> them from Sin (if we have it) by Power. We muſt not <hi>hate Sinners, and ſuffer them to ſin:</hi> we deſtroy thoſe whom we ſuffer to ſin, if we can hinder them. None may permit Sin in another, if he can reſtrain it, but he that can produce a greater Good out of it, than the permiſſion is an Evil. <hi>Reſtraining of Inferiors</hi> is as great a duty as <hi>Prayer for Superiours.</hi> See it in the caſe of <hi>Eli's</hi> negligence to reſtrain his Sons from their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 3. We muſt mourn for Sinners with advantaging them by <hi>Example,</hi> that they may never be able to tax us with thoſe Sins for which we would be thought ſorrowfull. Examples ſometimes have a louder voice than Precepts. Tears will not in ſecret drown thoſe Sins which publick Examples encourage. We confute our Tears and Prayers before God, by an unſuitable Example before the Offender. The blots of others cannot be wip'd off with blurred fingers. 4. We muſt follow our mourning for others Sins, with labouring to advantage them by holy <hi>Reproof</hi> for the Sins we mourn for. If our place and opportunities allow us, we muſt not only <hi>ſigh</hi> for their Sins, but <hi>cry</hi> againſt them: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Lot</hi> was not only a Mourner for the <hi>Sodomites</hi> Sins, but a <hi>Reprover.</hi> I know not whether it be a greater ſign of a Godly man, to give a Reproof duly, or to take a Reproof thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. 1. But be ſure Reproofs be given with <hi>Zeal</hi> for Gods Glory, not either out of hatred to the Perſon reproved, or out of deſire to promote thine own Reputation and Intereſt by the Reproof. The Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.14.17.16. reproved Idolaters; but Zeal for God purely put them upon it. <hi>Paul and Barnabas rent their Cloaths,</hi> as

Let the Sinner ſee thee kind to himſelf, when thou art moſt unkind to his Sin. 3. Let Reproofs be qualified with <hi>Prudence,</hi> by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and degree of the Offence, and the temper of the Offender. A ſmall Offence, like a Fly on the forehead, is not to be kill'd with a Beetle, nor is a <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſs (and ſo tender are ſome tempers) to be ſcowred with as much ſtrength as we ſcowre an Iron Pot with. Prudence is alſo to be obſerved in Reproofs, by care to preſerve our own ſafety, and not to expoſe our ſelves by indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and laviſh expreſſions, to the malice of thoſe whom we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. 4. Reprove Sinners with <hi>Patience;</hi> knock twice, nay thrice, at the door of a Sinners Conſcience. Importunity may prevail with a Sinner for his own Soul, if with the unjuſt Judge for another. <hi>Wait, if peradventure God may give the Sinner Repentance.</hi> 5. With expreſſing that <hi>Commiſeration</hi> towards a Sinner in private, which thou expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt for him before God in ſecret. A profane perſon going once to hear a Play, and telling of a Godly man whom he met, whither he was going; this good man intreated him to forbear, and not to go to ſo wicked a Meeting, that might eaſily endanger his Soul: but the man was obſtinate, and notwithſtanding all the Arguments the good man could uſe to hinder him from going, he told him he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go to the Play-houſe: with that the good man ſhed abundance of tears upon the beholding his obſtinacy. They part one from the other; the one, the reſolute perſon goes towards the Play-houſe; but juſt as he was entering into it, the remembrance of the tears ſhed by the godly diſſwader, ſo wrought upon him that he durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to go into that hurtful place, but returned from it without incurring the danger of that temptation.</p>

We ſhould not deſire any Glory that promotes not his, nor ſhould we ſhun any diſgrace, that ſets up his honour.

Though its Leaves be gilded, though its Branches ſhould have Pearls and Diamonds hung thick upon them, thô the Body be adorned with Sattens, and Cloath of Gold, yet this makes not the Tree better as a Fruit-tree. It would be better for the Tree to dung it than to adorn it. To cut its bark, than to beautifie its body. We ſhould embrace the vileſt debaſures, and the moſt torn and poor condition, if they conduce to our end, the glorifying of God, rather than by any ones Sin, to ſhine and be advanced in the World.

Sin drew not from our dear Lord Jeſus's eyes only tears of Water, but from his ſacred face great drops of Blood: 'Twas Sin that pierced not his feet, hands, and ſide only, but his Soul. Who can look upon the bloody Knife that ſtabb'd Chriſt, without ſome Sorrow? 2.

We are his Diſciples and Scholars, and 'tis our. Duty as much to make him our Example, as to expect he ſhould obtain our Pardon. Chriſt never had a Pollution, but oft a Commotion of Affection: Chriſt never wept but for Sin, or its effects. How full of Zeal was he for his Father, when he ſaw his Glory blemiſhed,<note place="margin">Joh. 2.17. Joh. 19.9, 10, 11.

'Tis obſervable, thô Chriſt in his own cauſe gave <hi>Pilate no anſwer,</hi> but ſtood ſilent; yet when he heard <hi>Pilate</hi> arrogate to himſelf the Power of Life and Death over Chriſt, he could not forbear to ſhew <hi>Pilate</hi> his Sin, by telling him of an higher Power than his, from whence his was derived. How full of grief was Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.41.</note> ſeeing the hardneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> hearts to their own deſtruction! In his approach to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> filled with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and him, he <hi>wept over it</hi> for their Blindneſs, and Impieties, and approaching Deſtruction: He bewail'd the Sins of thoſe that rejoyced in them; and ſhed his tears for thoſe that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhed his blood.

Should we not quench that Fire with our Tears, which we have blown up with our Bellowes of encouragement?

            <p>From all which thus explain'd, ariſeth this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the Duty of every Child of God,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> to keep themſelves in the Love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition is grounded upon a threefold Suppoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſome men are in the <hi>Love of God really, and eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Love wherewith God loveth his Choſen,<note place="margin">Rom. v. 8. 11, 12, 13.</note> is a <hi>ſpecial Love,</hi> a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is a <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as a <hi>Priviledge</hi> to keep our ſelves in the Love of God: our Activity, as well as Gods Act. Which will be hereafter more explained.</p>
            <p>Before we come to the main Queſtion, we will anſwer this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: <hi>How Love can be ſaid to be in God?</hi> for Love is a Paſſion in the Creature, and Paſſions are Imperfections, which are contrary to Gods Perfection.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42587:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is true: Nothing of Imperfection is in God; but Love is in God as a Perfection: becauſe Love is in God in the abſtract, that is eſſentially; for Abſtracts ſpeak Eſſences. <hi>God is Love.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p>The Love of God is either natural or voluntary, thus Divines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, and that well.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. Joh. 3.35. Joh. 5.20. Joh. 17.24.</note>1. The Natural Love of God is that wherewith God loves himſelf. That is, the reciprocal Love whereby the three Perſons love each other.</p>
            <p>This Eſſential Natural Love of God is therefore neceſſary. God cannot but love himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Love of God is voluntary: thus he loves his Creatures with a general Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he made them, and made them good, therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them:<note place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note> for though Sin be really evil, and none of Gods making, but contrary to God, and hated of God; yet God loves the Creatures as his Creatures, although ſinful, with a general Love.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44, 45.</note>2. He loves ſome Creatures with a ſpecial Love, and by this he loves Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.35. Eph. 1.6. 1 Joh. 4.9. Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note>1. This Love of God to Chriſt as Mediator, is the Foundation of Gods Love to his Elect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a ſpecial Love God loves his Elect. <hi>John</hi> 13.1. Of this Love it's ſaid that it is inſeparable.</p>
            <p>Now this is the peculiar Love which God bears to ſome above others. Not becauſe they were more lovely than others, nor becauſe God foreſaw they would believe and love him; but becauſe God loved them firſt antecedently to all thoſe things:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.3, 4, 5. Deut. 7.6, 7, 8. Eph. 2.3, 4, &amp;c. to 10.</note> and becauſe he loved them therefore Chriſt ſhall come and die, and therefore they ſhall believe in him and love him. The ſumm is this: Our Love to God is the Effect, and not the Cauſe of Gods Love to us: yea Chriſt himſelf as Mediator is the Effect of Gods Eternal Love. This is primitive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

               <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me.</hi> V. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi>

               <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.10. <hi>God commended his love toward us, that while we were yet Sinners and Enemies, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Upon which I would have old and new Donatiſts, which make God to love all alike, in order to their Salvation; and that there is no ſpecial Grace, let them read St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Tom. 9.

            <p>I have therefore named all theſe, becauſe there is a ſort of Men riſen up among us,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.6.7.</note> corrupters and perverters of the Word and Wayes of God, who raiſe up <hi>Donatiſm</hi> and <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> from the Death.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42587:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Gods Love to us at all, but of our Love to God only: Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I judge it ſpoken principally of Gods Love to us, not excluding our Love to God, but comprehending it, as a great ſign that God loves us, when we truly love God.

This is a great Art to ſtudy,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.17.</note> to know what is the will and Pleaſure of God, and to conform to it. The Reaſon whereof is this: Becauſe,</p>

            <p>But if mans commanding Will be agreeable to Gods revealed Will which is the Standard, then we pleaſe and not diſpleaſe God in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to man, becauſe ſubordinate things do not claſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="1">I. He that will keep himſelf in the Love of God, muſt he himſelf love God; for Love deſerveth Love, and Love begetteth Love: Gods Love worketh thus towards us, and therefore our Love muſt work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.<note place="margin">Prov. 4.6. Prov. 8.17.</note> Our Love to God is but the Reflection of the Beams of Gods Love upon us. Love Wiſdom and ſhe ſhall love thee; <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> And thus the Beams are doubled, and the Love of God to the Soul, and the Souls love to God encreaſeth the heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen both, as it is with the Sun ſhining on the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. He that loves God loving him,<note place="margin">Magnes amoris amor.</note> is drawn to God by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Beams of Divine Love: theſe are called the <hi>Bands of Love, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.</p>
            <p>He that loves God loving him, is inflamed with Gods Love; as it is in a Burning Glaſs. This is a Heavenly Fire, kindled from Heaven, and not eaſily quenched.<note place="margin">Cant. 8.7.</note>

            <p>He that loves God loving him, finds the ſtrongeſt Obligation upon him to Love God, as conſtrained to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. and God endears him to love God from his Heart; for Love raviſheth the Heart beyond all things in the World. The Lord and his Spouſe raviſh one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Cant. 4.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. He that will keep himſelf in the Love of God, muſt mind and meditate on four Attributes and Properties of Gods Love, which will have great influence upon his Heart and Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On the Eternity of Gods Love to him; which hath been ever, of old, time out of Mind; yea, before all Time he hath been <hi>thy Friend, and thy Fathers friend,</hi> therefore forget him not. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.10.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Election which is the effect of Gods Eternal Love, is Eternal. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>And becauſe he is Love eſſentially, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. therefore his Love is Eternal as himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4.</note>2. On the Freeneſs of Gods Love. All the Arguments of his Love are drawn out of his own Breaſt; therefore this free Love of God is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> which is no Grace unleſs it be gratuitous and free. <hi>Not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to works,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, the great Champion of Free Grace, which <hi>Bradwardin</hi> calls the Cauſe of God; <hi>but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>before the world began.</hi> And again, <hi>There is a remnant according to the election of grace: and if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi> O meditate on this! How ſhould the conſideration of this keep us in the Love of God!</p>
            <p>¶ Mark and mind this well. Free Grace and Love ſent Jeſus Chriſt into the World, and all the train of Spiritual Bleſſings. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The free Love of God was the Cauſe of Election. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The free Love of God is the cauſe of our effectual Vocation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The free Grace and Love of God is the cauſe of our Adoption. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6.</p>

            <p n="5">5. The free Love and Grace of God is the cauſe of the Pardon of Sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The free Grace and Love of God is the cauſe of true, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Converſion. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>

            <p n="8">8. The free Grace and Love of God is the cauſe of Chriſts ſuffering for us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Free Grace and Love of God is the Cauſe of that ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Jewel and Bleſſing, the Word of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.3.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The free Grace and Love of God is the cauſe of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 8.</p>

            <p>¶ O meditate and mind the infinite free Love of God in all the ſweet Streams of it, and dwell upon the meditation of it, and be raviſhed with it, and give the God of Grace and Love the Glory of it for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mind the Immenſity of Gods Love. This is ſo vaſt an Ocean, that thou wilt find neither Bounds, nor Bottom in it. Hear the Apoſtle upon it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height; and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> To know it to paſs all knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of this alone hath ſo amaz'd ſome devout Souls, that they have been in an Extaſie, above and beſides themſelves with it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mind and meditate on the Unchangeableneſs of Gods Love. This is grounded upon <hi>two immutable things by which it is impoſſible for God to lie.</hi> This, O!<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18.</note> this gives ſure Anchor-hold and comfort to a true Believer in a Storm. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>This Aſſurance God hath given his People of old. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love. Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi>

            <p>It is an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquenchable Love.</hi> Cant. 8.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If this be ſo, what need then of the Apoſtles Exhortation to keep our ſelves in the Love of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe Gods Promiſes and Believers Priviledges, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but include the uſe of Means.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God who prevents us with his Grace, and works upon us, and in us, unto Converſion, and Regeneration, hereby puts into us
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42587:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> an Active Principle; and helps and recruits it continually by auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Grace: Our habits of Grace ceaſe acting, if God ſuſpends the influence of Grace: as we ſee in <hi>Peters</hi> eaſe, both upon the Waters when he began to Sink, till the Lord gave him a Hand; and went on denying his Maſter, till the Lord looked upon him, and melted him into Tears. God will ever have us beholding to him, and lean upon him;<note place="margin">h. 15.4, 5.</note> and we are made up of nothing elſe but Dependency and Frailty, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.61. Now this active principle is chiefly Faith, and Love.<note place="margin">Faith working by Love.</note> Faith gives us union to Chriſt, and maintains that Union: Now as we are kept <hi>by Faith,</hi> ſo we and our Faith are kept both by the <hi>power of God to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Our Inheritance is kept in Heaven for us, and we are kept in Earth for it, till we poſſeſs it in Heaven. <hi>Quis cuſtodiet ipſos cuſtodes.</hi> We ſhould be poorly and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably kept, if the Lord were not our keeper. How did <hi>Adam</hi> keep his Eſtate, and the Angels theirs, and <hi>Eſau</hi> his Birth-right, and the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal his Portion, when all was truſted in their own hands?

               </note> even the hand of a Faithful God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. He that will keep himſelf in the Love of God, muſt keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free from the Love of the World: becauſe the Love of this World is contrary to the Love of God,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.15, 16.</note> and therefore inconſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Love of the World and its Trinity, or threefold Luſt, is a dangerous Heart-thief, it Steals away the Heart from God, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſtole away the Hearts of the People from <hi>David</hi> by his Kiſſes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.5, 6.</note> and Flatteries. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. What the Prophet ſpeaks of Wine and Whoredom, is true of all other worldly things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Love of the World makes God jealous, becauſe World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings make an Idol of it; and it is the worſt Idolatry, being that of the firſt Commandement.<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs: Luk.</hi> 12.15. A double caution; all little enough. And of this nature is Luxury, and Epicuriſm alſo. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. <hi>Drunkenneſs, the Love of Pleaſure more than God;</hi>

            <p>Nay thus it is likewiſe in the inordinate Love of Children, which is ſoon done: and they become Idols, and God in his jealouſie breaks them,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.21.</note> or breaks us for them, as he did old <hi>Eli,</hi> honouring his Sons above God. And <hi>he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me,</hi> (Math. 10.37.) ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Love of the World is a Choak-pear to all that's truly good; as is clear in the Thorny Ground. <hi>Math.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 7.22.

                  <hi>Rom. 7.24.</hi> Who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from the Body of this Death?</note> Do not we ſee what mortal Enemies worldly men are to Divine things? The Word ſaith, <hi>the world lyeth in wickedneſs;</hi> the Devil is the Prince of the wicked World, and <hi>ruleth in the children of diſobedience;</hi> it feeds the Fleſh, and nouriſheth the carnal part, and <hi>is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7.

            <p n="4">4. The Love of the World hath Sorcery, and Witchcraft in it: when once men drink of the Worlds Cup, they are intoxicated. We read of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> how he bewitched the People, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.9. We read of <hi>Jezebels</hi> Witchcrafts,<note place="margin">2 King. 9.22. Nahum 3.9. Rev. 17.2, 3, 4. <hi>Falſus, &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax eſt mundus, exterius aurens, interius lutens.</hi> N.

Sixteen in number. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Maxima totius orbis venefica:</hi> The greateſt Witch in the world, is the World. Her Honours are bewitching Honours; Her Delights and pleaſures are bewitching: Her Riches and Profits are bewitching. How then is the Love of the World conſiſtent with Gods Love? Therefore for the Love of God, love not the World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Love of the World, makes Men Apoſtates from Chriſt: So it made <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. and ſo it hath made thouſands more, and thee among the reſt if thou lookeſt not well to thy Self.</p>
            <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Pſal. 17.14. Phil. 3.18, 19, 20.</note> Becauſe the Love of the World makes men take up their Heaven on this ſide Heaven: Of thoſe men the Apoſtle could not ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Weeping: This is like the Prodigal, that preferred a Tavern, and a Brothel-Houſe, before his Fathers Houſe, <hi>Luc.</hi> 15.13.</p>
            <p n="5">V. He that will Love God, and keep himſelf in the Love of God, muſt not be a Self-lover: there is no greater Enemy to the Love of God than to Love our ſelves.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2.</note> Mark the place for it is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able place: He tells you of <hi>perilous times</hi> a coming, and there gives nineteen marks of ſuch men as make the times perilous: Of all which <hi>Lovers of themſelves</hi> leads the Van; for where once this Principle prevails, it opens a Floodgate to all Sin, and ſhuts the door upon all Holy Motions: If Self be beloved, admired and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, it is the worſt Idol in the World; this is an Idol in a ſecret place, continually adored; this is <hi>Dagon</hi> ſet above the Ark, and a Man above God, and provokes to jealouſie; this perverts the courſe of Nature, and Gods order, who is one God, and uppermoſt, and only to be adored: and men ſet up themſelves in Gods Throne, and Ungod him by deifying themſelves: and for one God, they ſet up millions of gods; as many gods as Creatures. This is mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by loſing the Integrity wherein God made him, and ſeeking out many Inventions. And when the Lord Chriſt came into the World, he he ſpeaks our Love, and wooes us for it, and commands ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal

            <p n="6">VI. If ye would keep your ſelves in the Love of God, be very ſhy of Sin, both in the Riſings of it, and as to the Temptations to it. For the love of God, and the love of Sin are more contrary to each other than Heaven and Hell. Becauſe they are Morally contrary.</p>

            <p>Therefore Converſion reconciles God to us, becauſe it mortifies Sin in us, by vertue of Chriſts Death for us.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. He that will keep himſelf in the Love of God, muſt clear up his Intereſt and Union to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="6">6. Becauſe the Father loveth whom Chriſt loveth, and he loveth them that love Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.27.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Becauſe our Intereſt in Chriſt puts a Soul out of all danger. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Chap. 7.24, 25.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Becauſe the Lord Jeſus makes the Fathers Love to him, the meaſure of his love to us: <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue in my love.</hi> Joh. 15.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> By this ye keep in Gods Love.</p>

            <p>Conſider all this, and how cogently they prove this Head, of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our Intereſt and Union unto Chriſt, to keep our ſelves in the Love of God.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. An eighth way of keeping our ſelves in the Love of God, is by keeping Gods Commandements: I do not mean as to a Covenant of Works, but upon a Goſpel account. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall abide in my Love, as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his Love.</hi> John 15.10. Verſ. 14. <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42587:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> whatſoever I command you.</hi> O! mind that. Again mark this: <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and doth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and we will make our abode with him.</hi> This Love is the fulfilling of the whole Law, and the Goſpel too. There be many that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement a Love to God, but will do nothing for him. The greatneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Love to God, and of <hi>David</hi>'s Love, and of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Love, and of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Love, of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Love, and of the Martyrs Love, was in doing and in dying for him.

            <p>We read of <hi>Labour of Love;</hi> becauſe true Love is Laborious: as it was in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Love for <hi>Rachel.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="12">XII. A further Means to keep our ſelves in the Love of God, is not only to love the Lord, but to keep up our Love to him to the height. Such a love as the Bride and Bridegroom have to each other, which is brisk and higheſt then.<note place="margin">Jer. 2.2. Rev. 2.4, 5.</note>

Therefore labour to keep up thy Love to the height towards God. Thou canſt never be exceſſive in thy Love to God; to the Creature thou mayſt, and commonly art: But behold the perverſneſs of Man in this Affection! We ſtint our Love to God where it ſhould know no bounds, nor meaſures; and we are boundleſs in our love to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which alwayes ought to be bounded.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. If we will keep our ſelves in the Love of God, let us labour to <hi>grow in Grace,</hi> and to carry on the work of it in our Souls to the higheſt perfection: This is grounded upon the Verſe immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text, <hi>viz. Ye beloved building up your ſelves in your moſt holy Faith;</hi> where the Participle <hi>(building)</hi> agrees with the Verb in the Text, <hi>(keep) your ſelves in the love of God:</hi> Noting this growth in Grace and Knowledge, to be an effectual means to keep our ſelves in the Love of God: Whether we underſtand this Clauſe, <hi>building up your ſelves in your moſt holy Faith,</hi> to be underſtood of the Doctrine of Faith, or the Grace of Faith, or of both, for we cannot well ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, they being helps to each other; according to that of <hi>Peter,</hi> who puts them both together, to <hi>grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and this is a Soveraign Remedy againſt <hi>falling away,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Now there is good reaſon why our growth in Grace, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Faith, is a principal means to keep our ſelves in the Love of God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42587:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. Becauſe the Power of God goes with Faith to keep us firm <hi>unto ſalvation;</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe by building up our ſelves in our moſt holy Faith, we <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> without Faith we cannot do that; and we gain upon his Love, for we are in the way of God, and doing his Will; this is the Will of God, even our Sanctification. <hi>He that hath my commandments and doth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.21.</note> 
               <hi>he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, my Father and I will love him.</hi> Joh. 15.9, 10. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue in my love.

            </p>
            <p n="14">XIV. A great Means of keeping our ſelves in the Love of God is this, to Pray in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. the verſe after my Text: Now we ſhall ſee how forcible and cogent this means is. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All good things come from God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. Prayer is the Key of Gods Cloſet, and Treaſury; we are meer Beggers, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our own, but are fain to beg our daily Bread of God, who keeps us from Hand to Mouth: God will have it ſo, becauſe he will have us know to whom we are beholding for all.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he Loves to ſee our Face, and hear our Voice, and the oftner the more welcome: And this he doth as tender Fathers uſe to do with their Children, who know what they need, but will have them come to them for all, with bended knees for their Fathers Bleſſing; nor ſhall they come in vain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Lord commands it, and approves it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath annexed great Promiſes to Prayer.</p>

By all which we ſee, how ſeaſonably the duty of Prayer and the Priviledge of Prayer is here annexed, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>to keep our ſelves in the Love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can Friends maintain their Amity, without frequent converſe? <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the Friend of God,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.23. Gen. 18.17. <hi>to the end.</hi>
               </note> and ye ſee what power he had with God in Prayer for wicked <hi>Sodom;</hi> God communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Secrets to him as one Friend to another; and <hi>Abraham</hi> made Interceſſion to him, as Favourites of Princes for Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: So did he for <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ye know how far he prevailed; for he was a Righteous man,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.16.</note> and ſuch a mans Prayer prevaileth much. And what was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Righteouſneſs? <hi>even the Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> by Imputation,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> and this Faith living, and working.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. We keep our ſelves in the Love of God, when we declare a publick Spirit for the Cauſe of God in his Church againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it; by being zealous for his Glory, and valiant for his Truth in our Station.<note place="margin">Judg. 5.</note> This is lively aſſerted in the Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> who after ſhe had praiſed ſome for their appearing, and others

            </p>
            <p>Now the Reaſon why this publick Spirit in the Cauſe of God is expreſſed by our Love to God, is this, Becauſe God is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to his Honour, to defend and deliver his People from his, and their Enemies, as the <hi>Midianites</hi> were.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to his Power, in reducing thirty thouſand to three hundred,<note place="margin">Jud. 7.</note> as in <hi>Gideons</hi> caſe, all that lapped.

To omit many other inſtances, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hearts in this caſe ſignally owned by God, becauſe they ſignally appeared for God. Thus <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 2.11, 13.<note place="margin">Judg. 5.9.</note> This was their Love. Thus ſaith <hi>Deborah, My Heart is towards the Governours of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that offer themſelves willingly; bleſs ye the Lord.

But <hi>Reuben, Gad, Manaſſeh, Dan,</hi> and <hi>Aſher,</hi> are branded for their Cowardiſe. I ſay all this appearing in the defence of all that was dear to God and them, is called Love to God. Therefore we may in no wiſe exclude this Noble publick Spirit in the cauſe of God and his People, from the Love of God; for there is no principle in the World, like to the Love of God,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Scripture is full of this Language.</p>
            <p>There is no higher Act of Love in God, than to eſpouſe a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be his own, and to give them a Rule of Worſhip of his own Inſtitution, and to hold them to it, as he did <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And when a People follows God, and ſerves God according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are no higher Acts of Love towards him in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

The Communion of Saints, is our Participation of all the good things of God in common, whereunto all the Saints, and only they, have right, conſiſting in our Union to God, as our chiefeſt good; this is with God as a Father, with the Son, and Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have Communion with the Father as Children: and all in the greateſt Love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17.</p>
            <p>This is procured by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. only obtained by Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. And maintained by the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Who walk not in darkneſs but in light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
            <p>By which we are made partakers of him, of his Nature, and of his Grace, and of his Glory; all which is done by Faith, that unite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and marrying Grace; and this works ſuch Conjugal Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church, as makes them ſpiritually Bone of each others Bone, and Fleſh of each others Fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p>¶ We maintain our Communion with Chriſt not only by Eating <hi>with</hi> him,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.53. to <hi>ver.</hi> 57.</note> but alſo by Eating <hi>of</hi> him.</p>
            <p>¶ God the Father calls us into Fellowſhip with his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.12.</note>¶ Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our Hearts by Faith; and by his Spirit alſo, <hi>for he that hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of his.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3.14.</note>This our fellowſhip and Communion with Chriſt, is evidenced by our Perſeverance in Grace firmly to the End.</p>

            <p>This our Fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt is confirmed by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that is <hi>Baptized</hi> into Chriſt, hath <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Supper,</hi> which is therefore called the <hi>Communion,</hi> becauſe the Saints gather together in that, as the higheſt act of their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Lord and with one another.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Bread that we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? The Cup that we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Children of God walking in the light have thereby fellowſhip with Chriſt, and one with another, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon, ſo we have fellowſhip with him in both Natures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his Humane Nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Partaking with him in the ſame Fleſh and Blood.</p>
            <p>¶ In the Spirit. <hi>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>¶ We have Communion with Chriſt in Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>If ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may be glorified together: Who ſhall change our vile Body, and faſhion it like to his glorious Body.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 22, 23, 24.</p>

Now let me propound a few Incentives to blow, and ſtir up the dying embers of Divine Love in our Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No man can love God truly, unleſs he <hi>know</hi> God truly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. <hi>If any man love God, the ſame is known of him;</hi> therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what knowledge thou haſt of God, eſpecially what practical Knowledge. It is clear, practical, Goſpel Knowledge, to <hi>know God in Christ,</hi> this is ſaving, and brings <hi>Life Eternal, Joh.</hi> 17.3.</p>
            <p>This is Knowledge that transforms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>This is a Sanctifying Knowledge, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21, 22.</p>
            <p>This is a juſtifying Knowledge, or the Knowledge of Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>This Light and Knowledge comes in to the Soul by the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit of God, turning our darkneſs into light, and is the teaching of God, and the <hi>anointing of God,</hi> teaching all things.<note place="margin">Joh. 6.46. Joh. 2.20, 27.</note> This principally teacheth us theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Love of God in Chriſt to us.</item>
               <item>2. The Lovelineſs of Chriſt, to inflame our love to him, by his Beauty and Excellency.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now when we clearly ſee, and duely conſider this, our Hearts are marvellouſly drawn out in Love to the Lord: And without this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God we can never truly love him: O pray for it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and improve the Means of it.</p>
            <p>This is that which the Apoſtle points at, as the moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of all other in the World, which carnal Hearts are no wayes capable of without the work of Gods Spirit in the Soul. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. to the end; read and mind that Scripture well. There are ſome things which we can never ſee in their Excellencies, without the help of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcopes and Perſpective glaſſes; by reaſon of the weakneſs and dimneſs of our ſight: In like manner we can never ſee the Amiableneſs of God in Chriſt, without the help of Gods Spirit. This ſets the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Top of a high Mountain, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the Top of <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah</hi>) whereby he gains a proſpect of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> or as Chriſt and his Diſciples upon <hi>Tabor</hi> in the Transfiguration,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.17, 18. 2 Cor. 12.2, 3, 4.</note> from that excellent Glory.</p>
            <p>Or ſuch a ſight as <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Rapture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond means and Motive to blow up the Flame of Divine Love in us, is to conſider; That the Lord is incomparably the moſt

            </p>
            <p>If we Love a drop of good in the Creature, how ſhould we be raviſhed with an Ocean,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.7, 8.9, 10.</note> many Oceans in God! Happy he that enjoyes the Fountain of good, for <hi>with him is the well of Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>God is purely good without Mixture, infinitely good without Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, abſolutely good without Dependency, communicably good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Failure, eternally good without End, ſay the Schools; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt amiable: O conſider this.</p>
            <p>And this good, <hi>this God is ours, for ever and ever,</hi> may every Believer ſay. O let this inflame our Love to this good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Examine thy Faith in the Truth of it, and labour for the growth of it, and obſerve the working of it: for true Faith works by Love; and the ſtronger thy Faith is, the ſtronger thy Love is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewing the excellency of Faith, and of a tryed Faith, that it is more precious than Gold, he ſaith, by it we love Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt though we never ſaw him with our bodily Eyes; and we love him by Believing, and rejoyce in it with <hi>unſpeakable glorious Joy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aug. Tract. <hi>7.</hi> in <hi>1</hi> Joh.</note>Faith is the firſt Principle, and chief root of all Operation in the Soul; and it is therefore a vain thing to talk of loving God, without Believing,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> for <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> God doth not put the Oyl of his Mercy, but into the Veſſel of Faith: <hi>We believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſpeak,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; we believe, therefore we love. What made the Saints not value worldly Treaſures, and Delights? What made them Love not their lives to the Death? What made them ſo wonderful, in their Active and Paſſive Obedience for Chriſt, but their Faith, by ſeeing him that is inviſible? for there is not ſuch an Eye on Earth,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24, 25, 26, 27.</note> that ſee Spiritual things in their Spirituality, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their remoteſt diſtance; ſuch a Faith doth break forth in the flames of Love to God, that thereby the Heart, where it is, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed by it; the Lord ſaith, his Heart is alſo <hi>raviſhed with that Eye,</hi> Cant. 4.9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, that God beſt deſerves thy Love: All the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vye with God in loving us, therefore are not worthy to be Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals with him: It is a horrid and an amazing thing, how the glorious God ſhould ſo far be provoked by ſuch Rivals, and bear ſo long. Of this he complained ſeverely in his People of old:<note place="margin">Jer. 2.5, 11, 12, 13, 31, 32.</note> Read the Prophets, and that one Chapter for inſtance. And this is true of the greateſt part of the World; one ſilly Idol or other courts all of them; yet they never did any man any good, nor can it, but hurt: By loving them they cannot love us again; they cannot ſave us in our trouble; they cannot hear us when we cry,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.28.</note> no more than <hi>Baal</hi> did his Prieſts, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.26. Our love is loſt upon them, they diſtreſs us but help us not: Like Summer-Brooks that are dry when we moſt need them, <hi>Job</hi> 6.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42587:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>What ſay you, doth not the Lord beſt deſerve your Love? what is there that he hath not done for you? you owe him not only for your Bleſſings, but for your Being: You ſtand indebted to him for <hi>all things pertaining to life and godlineſs,</hi> for all in hand and hope: And how many grow fat and wanton under the Mercyes of God,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> yea <hi>Jeſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> kicking at his Bowels, and beating the Breaſts that feed them! Strange, degenerate Brats,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.2, 3.

Will any Creature in the world whom thou Idolizeſt, do this for thee? Is this after the manner of men? No, it is the peculiar kindneſs of God only; think on it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider, if thou love the Lord truly, and keep thy ſelf in his Love, thy heart will ceaſe to love any thing elſe in the World, and be dead to Creatures, and they will be dead to thee. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Si cor amore Chriſti inardeſcit, omnis creatura vileſcit;</hi> All things are contemptible to one that truly loves God. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. When the Sun ſhines, the Stars vaniſh; and when it ſhines upon a Fire, it puts the Fire out. So doth the Love of God in the Soul extinguiſh all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love: And this is an infallible ſign of the love of God in the Soul; for they two are contrary, and mortal Enemies one to the other, and ſeek the deſtruction of each other. The reaſon is plain:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They differ in their Riſe, and Offspring; one is Heaven-born,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> the other is Earthly.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They differ in their Quality, one hates what the other loves.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) They differ in their Objects: One loves God, the other loves the Creature.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) They differ in the Means of their Attainments; one minds the Will and Word of God, to follow that only; the other minds the Wills and Luſts of the fleſh, to fulfill them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. and to make proviſion for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. laſt <hi>v.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) They differ in their End. The love of Creatures is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and loſt, the Love of God enjoyes him for ever,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1, 2.</note> and reſts ſatisfied in that enjoyment, and not before.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider, thou canſt never keep thy ſelf in the Love of God, if thou art not quit, and utterly diſengaged from the love of the World, in the Luſts and Vanities of it, by thy inordinate deſires and hankerings after it.</p>
            <p>God never comes into the Soul till the World go out,<note place="margin">Taulerus.</note> and then the Soul moves nobly when it moves to its Principle. This makes the Circular motion of the Heavens to be moſt Noble, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns alwayes to the ſame point where it began. Thus <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove found no reſt out of the Ark, but returned to it after long fluttering about, becauſe it found no food among the Carrion, but the Raven did, and therefore abode by it. A Bird as long as it flyes aloft in the Air, is free from the Fowlers Gin; but when it lights down on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42587:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ground, and falls a picking in the Earth, then is neareſt unto danger: Thus it fares with men of the Earth. <q>O poor Soul (ſaith St. <hi>Aug.</hi>) how doſt thou debaſe thy ſelf! thou loveſt earthly things, and thou art better than them; thou admireſt the Sun, and thou art more beautifull and excellent than the Sun; only God is above thee, and thou wert made to love him only.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Child of Heaven, and a Son of the Earth differ in this as much as Heaven and Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.10.</note>The Ground is curſed, and this World ſhall be burnt up, why art thou enamour'd with it?</p>
            <p>Therefore the Lord imbitters the Worlds Breaſts to his Children, that they may be weaned, and no longer ſuck of them; and then when the world begins to be bitter to us, the Lord begins to be ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us.</p>

            <p n="1">1. All that hath hitherto been ſaid of this great Duty of Keeping our ſelves in the Love of God, is Practical, and carryes Application with it, containing true ſigns of ſuch as keep themſelves in Gods Love. What is that but a great Uſe of Examination of our State and of our Practice? 1. Whether we are in the Love of God? 2. Whether we do indeed walk ſo as to keep our ſelves in it? Be not deceived, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your State, Heart and Life with theſe Rules; be ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn in it.</p>

            <p>They hate the Knowledge of God, they hate the People of God, they hate the Wayes of God, they love thoſe that hate God, and whom God hates: Can theſe think themſelves in the Love of God?

            <p n="5">5. If ye mind this Duty aright, to <hi>keep your ſelves in the love of God,</hi> (1) You muſt labour to underſtand the love of God to his Elect true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then meditate duely on it, and then walk worthy of it: Now this Love of God, I cannot more compendiouſly declare, than by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed be God, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in heavenly places in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which ye are to obſerve ſix remarkable things, in Gods bleſſing of us, for which we are to bleſs him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God the Father of Chriſt is the Author of all our Bleſſings, eſpecially of Spiritual Bleſſings, Election, Redemption, and all that flow from thence, are given us upon the account of Chriſt, by whom God becomes our Father, that is by Adoption; by which we have the right of Inheritance, that is Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by the word <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> he includes all things pertaining to Salvation, becauſe he ſaith <hi>with all ſpiritual Bleſſings,</hi> alluding to Gods Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onss of the earth he bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore he will give the conſummation of this Bleſſing at the day of Judgment to his Elect, ſaying, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42587:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> i. e. from his Everlaſting Love, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Father <hi>loves</hi> and <hi>bleſſeth</hi> us, that is his Choſen ones, and none elſe;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4, 5.</note> who declare themſelves ſuch, by their Faith, and Holineſs, and Love, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That theſe Bleſſings are principally Spiritual Bleſſings, ſuch as the Elect only receive, in a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing way; and that under two Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are not <hi>carnal</hi> Bleſſings, though the Father denyes not theſe to his Children, for which his Child muſt bleſs him; but here they are called <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> becauſe chiefly ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are not <hi>common</hi> ſpiritual Bleſſings neither; ſuch are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1 Cor. 13.</note> a great degree of Knowledge even in Spiritual things, yea a taſte alſo of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Beginning of a pious Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But only ſaving Grace, and Eternal Glory, the Fruit of Eternal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for all other ſpiritual Bleſſings follow and flow from that, as the true Knowiedge of God, a living Faith, effectual Calling, Juſtification, Sanctification, a Chriſtian Life, Love to the Saints, and Life Eternal; this the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>all Bleſſing,</hi> as containing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all fully, and perfectly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But there is one thing more to be noted from that word, <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places:</hi> For as carnal Bleſſings have their Beginning in the Earth, and there they end; ſo heavenly Bleſſings come from Heaven, and terminate there in Glory without end. Therefore we render it <hi>in heavenly places,</hi> becauſe it notes the Place of it which is Heaven, where Chriſt is exalted in Glory as our Head, to communicate and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all ſpiritual Bleſſings on his elected, and redeemed Members. There it's ſaid,<note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>in heavenly places in Chriſt:</hi> All this is amplified in this firſt, and more particularized in the ſecond; where he ſaith, He <hi>hath quickned us together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>and raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together with Chriſt in heavenly places.</hi> All this is an high act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love toward us. By which three things here and in Heaven, all Grace and Glory is meant, and that Saints do partake of them with and by Chriſt: And this leads to a</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixth thing, wherein the Love of God to us is declared in the place afore cited, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which, is aſſigned the material Cauſe of all Spiritual Bleſſings, namely, Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and High-Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are bleſſed <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> i. e. for Chriſts ſake, and upon his account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the Merits of Chriſt, by his Obedience, Paſſion and Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our Head, from whom as ſuch all our Bleſſings flow, in our Souls and Bodies; therefore is he called <hi>the Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. That is, in the Perſon of Chriſt: We are <hi>raiſed</hi> with him, and <hi>ſit in Heaven</hi> with him; <hi>i. e.</hi> We are counted raiſed, and ſitting there, by his Dignity and Glory, as our Head.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42587:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>By this Imputation, the Papiſts Juſtification by Inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is fully confuted.</p>
            <p>Alſo we have infinite Priviledge and Comfort, that the Lord Jeſus is made to us his members, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, which can never be had any other way, either within us, or without us, but in Chriſt our Head only, and there only it is perfect and ſure; and all this in love. For the Father hath demonſtrated his love to Chriſt for this his undertaking, and his love to us becauſe he appointed him for us, and accepts us in him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt Branch of the fifth Uſe, of Studying the Love of God to us in Chriſt, in all the Cauſes of it, and in all the Parts of it: For this is a ſtrong Motive to keep us, in this Love, to underſtand it, and to believe it, and to walk up to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch: To underſtand and practiſe our Love to the Lord, anſwering his Love to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Underſtand what Love that is wherewith we are to love the Lord, and whereby we keep our ſelves in his Love to us:<note place="margin">Matth. 22.36, 37.</note> In order unto this, ye are to know, that the whole Worſhip of God conſiſts in the Love of God. Hence <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <q>The Love of God is the form of all Vertue, yea the Head and Foundation of all true Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The end of the Law is Love out of a pure heart, a good Conſcience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>and Faith unfeigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things that are in true Love:
<list>
                  <item>1. To be affected with a deſirable Object, upon our knowledge of it to be good.</item>
                  <item>2. To be carryed out ſtrongly in our Deſires after it, that we may be united with it.</item>
                  <item>3. When we enjoy it, to Rejoyce in it, and to reſt in it, as in our End, and Center of our Deſires.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This the word ſignifies in the Original Hebrew and Greek:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> To reſt greatly in the enjoyment of the thing beloved; as Etymologiſts have it, <hi>Phavorinus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So true Love contains in it, Affection, Deſire, Joy, as the Beginning, Progreſs, and End of it; and this will be perfect in Heaven, and our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Happineſs. In this, Love outvyes all other Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>We have an excellent Saying of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to this purpoſe:<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>4.</hi> libro de ſubſtantiâ dilectionis. <hi>Cap. 6.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>This is then the reſt of the Soul, when it is fixed by the Love of God, as to its deſire, nor deſires any thing or Object beſides, but having got poſſeſſion of that which it deſires, is wholly taken up with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of it, and is happy in the ſecure enjoyment of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we are to learn, wherein the true Nature of our Love of God ſtands; that the Heart reſt in the enjoyment of what it deſires, which it can do in nothing elſe: And only our Love to God is true, and perfect Love, becauſe our Souls find reſt in God only.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes four degrees of our Love to God:</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a man loves Himſelf <hi>for</hi> himſelf; but herein he can have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42587:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> no reſt nor content, for it is not to be found in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he loves God for himſelf, and not for God; when he would have God make him happy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he loves God for God himſelf, as judging him moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all love.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When he loves himſelf, and all things elſe for God only, and is therein ſatisfied, deſiring nothing more.</p>
            <p>This is indeed to love God, when we love him for himſelf, and our ſelves and all other things ſubordinately unto God, in him, and for him only. Our Soul as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove hath no reſt till it return to this Ark.</p>
            <p>This Injoyment ſatisfies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> ye <hi>ſhall be abundantly</hi> ſatisfied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8, 9. becauſe it is the <hi>water of life,</hi> which being once drunk of, quencheth thirſt for ever.</p>
            <p>I conclude all with this, that conſidering the Circumſtances into which we are caſt, it is our Duty, Wiſdom and Priviledge to keep our ſelves in the Love of God; from the tranſcendent Advantages we have by it above the love and favour of men; which is hard to get, and yet not worth the pains when gotten; yea when gotten, it is as hard to keep, and yet not worth the keeping; yea it is eaſily loſt, and better loſt than kept: Therefore never labour to keep thy ſelf in the Love of Men, by which thou mayſt loſe the love of God; but keep your ſelves in the Love of God, and that will keep you ſafe here and for ever.</p>
            <p>The Lord gives it as a Reaſon why he would not caſt off his People, though he threatned them as if he would do it,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 11.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am God, and not Man:</hi> It is not after the manner of men, to be conſtant in their Love, but is like Himſelf, and never breaks off or keeps in his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.5, 6, 7, 8.</note>The Lord will be called <hi>Husband</hi> of his People; and is he not the beſt and deareſt in the World?

            <p n="2">2. This wickedneſs of theſe unconverted Children hath been, and is too too often <hi>occaſion'd,</hi> yea advanced by the Sinful <hi>ſeverity,</hi> or <hi>indulgence,</hi> of their unwary, thô gracious Parents. This Head di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it ſelf into <hi>TWO</hi> Branches: <hi>viz.</hi> Parents Sinful <hi>ſeverity,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinful ſeverity,</hi> and of this, 1. What it is not. 2. What it is.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>What it is not?</hi> 1. <hi>A grave, wiſe, holy, ſtrict demeanour towards our Children;</hi> ſuch a carriage, as whereby we may procure Glory to God,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42587:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> Honour to our ſelves, and ſo to preſerve and keep up that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which God hath ſtampt upon us, <hi>is not ſinful Severity.</hi> To car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſo, and ſo to keep our diſtance, as to give our Children no occaſion to undervalue, or <hi>deſpiſe us:</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note> So, as that they may ſee, and own the Wiſdom of God ſhining in us; that our Children may pay us that reverence, and reſpect that God requires of them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.28. This is not to be accounted <hi>ſinful Severity,</hi> but behaving our ſelves <hi>worthily</hi> in <hi>Ephratah, Ruth</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All juſt anger,</hi> or the riſing up of the Heart in an holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure <hi>againſt Sin in our Children, is not ſinful ſeverity.</hi> Parents may be angry, and yet not ſin. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. Nay Parents would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin, if, <hi>on juſt occaſion</hi> given by their Children, they ſhould not be angry; but with theſe <hi>proviſo's:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the cauſe,</hi> for which they are angry, <hi>be good,</hi> and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Such as we can give a good Account of to God. An anger, like that of our <hi>Saviour, who looked round about on his malicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers with anger, being griev'd for the bardneſs of their hearts,</hi> Mark 3.5. When our anger is accompanied <hi>with grief,</hi> becauſe God is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd</hi> by our Childrens offending againſt Truth, Piety, Juſtice, Humanity; becauſe we ſee them neglect their duty, <hi>hurt their own, or others Souls, or Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Object of this anger be right:</hi> i. e. when that which we are angry at, is not ſo much <hi>the perſons</hi> of our Children that offend, as <hi>their offence it</hi> ſelf; their Sin, Fault, Diſobedience. Not ſo much the Patient, as the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the End be right,</hi> viz. that the fault we are offended at, may be <hi>amended</hi> by our Children, and that they for the future may be <hi>warned not to offend</hi> in the like again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That a due decorum may be obſerved both as to the meaſure, and duration of our Anger.</hi> When it is neither too <hi>hot,</hi> nor too <hi>long.</hi> When it is a Rational, Holy, Temperate diſpleaſure, a <hi>moderate anger,</hi> when right Reaſon, and Scripture fit in the Box, and Guide the <hi>Chariot,</hi> ſaying as the Lord to the Sea, Thus <hi>much,</hi> thus <hi>long,</hi> and no more, no longer: Thus far no ſinful ſeverity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Grave counſelling, and admoniſhing our Children in and to that which is truly good,</hi> Eph. 6.4. All ſerious diſcountenancing of, and ſevere frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, when in an evil way; <hi>nay</hi> ſharp <hi>reproofs, and rebukes.</hi> Tit. 1.13. Yea being ſo far a <hi>terror</hi> to them, as to let them know, we bear not the ſtamp of Gods Authority <hi>in vain. Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4. Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſmart chaſtiſing of them proportionable to their Age, and offence. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.15. Provided, we expreſs <hi>fatherly love and tenderneſs</hi> in all, out of a true <hi>deſire of their Repentance, and Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is not to be lookt upon as ſinfull Severity, but as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of a <hi>neceſſary parental duty;</hi> which is by ſo much the more <hi>excellent,</hi> becauſe it is ſo much <hi>neglected,</hi> and ſo hard to be performed in a right manner.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) What <hi>Sinful Severity</hi> is; or wherein it diſcovers it ſelf. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42587:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> Severity betrayes it ſelf in and by the irregular <hi>paſſions,</hi> auſtere <hi>looks,</hi> bitter <hi>words,</hi> and rigid <hi>Actions</hi> of thoſe Parents, who <hi>abuſe</hi> their Parental <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the wickedneſs of unconverted Children is oftentimes occaſion'd by this Sinful ſeverity of their Parents.</hi> They are <hi>provok'd,</hi> and that to <hi>Sin,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By <hi>irregular Paſſions,</hi> ſpecially that of an inordinate, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Raſh anger;</hi> when Parents are <hi>ſoon</hi> angry with their Children, when they will not give leave to their Judgments to <hi>conſider,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are angry. The wiſe man tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam. 1.19.</hi> Multos abſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſi prius coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimus judicare, quam iraſci. <hi>Sen. de ira.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the diſcretion of a man defers his anger,</hi> and that it is his Glory, to paſs over a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. But brands raſh anger with the <hi>mark of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> He that is <hi>ſoon angry, dealeth fooliſhly,</hi> Prov. 14.17. 'Twas grave advice to one, not to be angry at any time, till he had firſt repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Greek Alphahet.</hi> To be angry without any cauſe, or upon <hi>every trivial,</hi> ſlight occaſion; for any thing, that is not material in it ſelf, or in it's conſequent; for meer involuntary, and caſual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and <hi>ſlips</hi> in our Children, ſuch as without great care could not have been prevented; and for theſe to be ſo far exaſperated, as to begin to <hi>hate,</hi> or more <hi>remiſly to love</hi> them, is for a Father to fire the <hi>Beacon</hi> of his Soul, for the Landing of a <hi>Cock-boat.</hi> 'Tis that, that expoſes the Father to his Childs contempt, and Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a Parents anger is too <hi>frequent,</hi> too <hi>hot,</hi> or too <hi>long. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> muſt be us'd as a <hi>Medicine,</hi> only now, and then, and that only on a <hi>juſt</hi> occaſion: otherwiſe, it loſeth its Efficacy, or hurts the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. <hi>Again,</hi> Anger, when <hi>too hot,</hi> vehement, exceſſive, provokes. 'Tis True: It muſt be <hi>ſerious,</hi> there muſt be ſome Life, and <hi>warmth</hi> in it: the <hi>Potion</hi> muſt be <hi>warm'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ira ſic dicta, quaſi hominem faciat ex ſe ire, &amp; non eſſe apud. ſe.</note> that it may <hi>operate</hi> the more <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly</hi> towards the Reformation of offending Children: but then when it <hi>ſwells</hi> into an exceſs, and <hi>tranſport</hi> of paſſion, it provokes. Such an exceſs of Anger, like a <hi>Ball of Wild-fire,</hi> is very apt to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame</hi> the Childs breaſt, and to provoke him into a ſinful return of wrath and ſtrife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Anger, when <hi>too long,</hi> when it lies <hi>ſoaking</hi> in the breaſt, is apt to putrifie. If the Sun ariſes, and ſets on a man in his wrath, the Text tells us, who is like to be his Bedfellow, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26, 27. <hi>Anger reſts in the Boſom of a fool,</hi> Eccl. 7.9. And well may it provoke a Child, thô criminal, to ſee his Fathers <hi>Boſom,</hi> where once he lay, to be now become Angers <hi>Couch,</hi> and Satans <hi>Pillow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, that <hi>Irregular</hi> Paſſions in ſevere Parents are no little Provocations and <hi>ſpurs</hi> to Sin, and wrath in their diſobedient Children: They are like thoſe ſmart <hi>Cantharides,</hi> or Spaniſh-flies, the moſt ſpeedy, and effectual means to raiſe <hi>bliſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>By an auſtere look, grim, ſour, louring, frowning countenance;</hi> when a man ſeems to carry revenge, <hi>daggers, death</hi> in his Face; when a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42587:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> man uſually looks on his Child,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.5, 6.</note> as <hi>Cain</hi> did on his Brother, as one highly diſpleas'd, that bears Ill-will, and <hi>ones</hi> him a <hi>grudge,</hi> and will be ſure to <hi>pay</hi> it in due time. When the Child obſerves his Anceſtors <hi>Creſt</hi> pourtray'd on his Fathers forehead, and inſtead of <hi>ſmiles</hi> can ſee nothing there but cruel <hi>Lions,</hi> Bears, <hi>Tigers:</hi> This muſt needs highly provoke, and 'tis not to be wondred at, if the Child, in a fright, and dreadful indignation, cries out roaring, <hi>I do well to be angry, even to the Death.</hi> Better to be <hi>kill'd</hi> outright, than <hi>buried alive:</hi> No grave ſo dark, ſo diſmal, as thoſe deep <hi>furrows</hi> in my frowning, conſtantly <hi>frowning</hi> Fathers <hi>forehead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) By <hi>bitter, haſty,</hi> biting, <hi>teſty,</hi> diſdainful, <hi>reproachful,</hi> railing, <hi>taunting,</hi> menacing, <hi>threatning words;</hi> Words <hi>ſteep'd</hi> in the Venom of <hi>Aſps.</hi> Oh, theſe pierce deep, like the Tails of <hi>Scorpions,</hi> and do <hi>highly</hi> provoke. More <hi>particularly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Hard Words. <hi>Soft</hi> Words, and <hi>hard</hi> Arguments work <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> A ſoft Tongue <hi>breaks the bones, Prov.</hi> 25.15. or one that is ſtiff, and hard. <hi>Abigail</hi> found it true in her addreſs to <hi>David,</hi> when he was in his rough: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.4. But an hard Tongue <hi>hardens</hi> the Heart. <hi>A ſoft Anſwer puts away wrath, but grievous words ſtir up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Prov.</hi> 15.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But what do you ſpeak of <hi>Words,</hi> which are but <hi>Wind?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3.5.</note>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> True, but this Wind many times <hi>kindles</hi> a dreadful <hi>fire,</hi> and encreaſes it, when once kindled. As Coles to burning Coles, and Wood to Fire, ſo is a contentious man to kindle ſtrife.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Contumacious, reproachful, diſgraceful words.</hi> Theſe are far remote from fatherly Love, and reſpect. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Rhet.</hi> tells us, that the grand <hi>ſcope,</hi> drift, deſign of <hi>contumely</hi> is, that a man may rejoyce, and <hi>triumph</hi> in the <hi>diſgrace</hi> of Him, whom he reproacheth. How <hi>barbarous</hi> is it then, to rejoyce in the diſgrace and <hi>infamy</hi> of a <hi>Child</hi> of a mans own <hi>Bowels?</hi> This cannot but <hi>provoke.</hi> That's a <hi>thunder-clap</hi> in the ears of Teſty, reproachful Parents, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay Thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell fire, Mat.</hi> 5.22. Reproachful words are no leſs than <hi>ſharp darts, and keen Swords;</hi> nay they carry with them no leſs than <hi>ſtings,</hi> and <hi>poiſon,</hi> ſo that even the wiſeſt, and beſt of men can hardly bear the <hi>dine</hi> of them. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> to the heighth provokes his Son, when he foams at the Mouth, and breaks out into that <hi>naſty drivel,</hi> 1 Sam. 20.30. <hi>Thou Son of the perverſe, rebellious Woman,</hi> (and why not in our Engliſh dialect, <hi>Thou Son of a Whore?</hi>) and ſo laſheth his Son on his <hi>Wives</hi> back; what could have been ſpoken more ſharply to provoke?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Menacing, <hi>threatning Words,</hi> and that, it may be, for little <hi>tripps,</hi> or ſlips of youth, nay, thô there be no reſolution to execute what they threaten. Suppoſe it only <hi>Brutum Fulmen,</hi> A Flaſh without a <hi>bolt,</hi> or Bullet. The very Wind, and noiſe is enough to ſink the trembling Child into a <hi>Swoon.</hi> If <hi>Maſters muſt not threaten Servants,</hi> much leſs may Parents threaten <hi>Children. Eph.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>By rigid Actions.</hi> When Parents utterly unmindful of their
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42587:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> parental Relation, <hi>bowels,</hi> duty, prove <hi>tyrants;</hi> and uſe, or rather <hi>abuſe</hi> their Children, as <hi>Servants,</hi> or indeed as <hi>Slaves,</hi> and vaſſals. Theſe ſhould know, that the great God never <hi>commiſſion'd</hi> them to be more than tender <hi>Governours,</hi> not domineering <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſters. This Tyranny is exercis'd divers wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When Parents either deny to, or take from their Children thoſe things, which either belong to their neceſſities, or their juſt comforts, in that rank, and Relation, in which their heavenly Father by birth hath plac'd them.</hi> When they deny them that Education, that Proviſion, that Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, which is <hi>Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Equal;</hi> that Food, Raiment, Portion, that <hi>becomes</hi> the Children of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Father.

Now concerning this I ſhall give you my thoughts under theſe two generals.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall lay before you plain Inſtances of this <hi>ſinful</hi> Indulgence in <hi>three</hi> Parents, <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>Fathers,</hi> (for, after a moſt <hi>exact</hi> ſearch throughout the whole <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I cannot find one, <hi>no not one</hi> of all the godly <hi>Mothers</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> guilty of, or <hi>charged</hi> with this ſin, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah only excepted,) two</hi> of theſe Fathers were <hi>beyond all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> truly, yea <hi>eminently</hi> godly, the third <hi>probably</hi> ſo, by the tender reſpect he ſhew'd the <hi>Levite:</hi> We begin with him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Indulgence of Parents is the bane of Children, a Pandar of their wickedneſs, the</hi> Aſylum <hi>of their vanity.</hi> How eaſily is the <hi>Thief</hi> induced to Steal, when he knows his <hi>Receiver?</hi> When the looſneſs of Youth knows where to find <hi>pity and toleration,</hi> what miſchief can it forbear? See this in the <hi>Levites Concubine or Wife,</hi> Judg 19.1, 2. This Concubine <hi>plays the Whore againſt the Levite, whom ſhe own'd at leaſt as an Huſband.</hi> Her guilt makes her fly, but whither <hi>ſhall ſhe cauſe her ſhame to go?</hi> whither indeed, but to her <hi>own dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe?</hi> She that had deſerv'd to be <hi>abhorr'd</hi> by her loving and faithful Husband, doubts not to <hi>find ſhelter</hi> from her <hi>fond</hi> and indulgent Father, his heart, and houſe, and boſom, ſhe knew would <hi>all be</hi> open to her.

I had rather be a <hi>juſt man,</hi> than a <hi>ſinfully-kind Father.</hi> Get thee <hi>home</hi> therefore to thy Husband, crave his Forgiveneſs upon thy <hi>Knees;</hi> redeem his Love with thy <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> When his <hi>Heart</hi> is once <hi>open</hi> to thee, my <hi>doors</hi> ſhall not be <hi>ſhut;</hi> in the mean time, before thou art humbled both before God and man, <hi>Know,</hi> I can be no Father to an <hi>Harlot.</hi> Thus methinks I ſhould have heard him ſay; but lo, <hi>fond Father</hi> that he was, he treats and <hi>careſſes</hi> her at another rate, and ſeems to beſpeak her, as <hi>Jael</hi> did <hi>Siſera, Judg.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Turn in my dear Child, turn in to me:</hi> He brings her into his Houſe, covers her with a Mantle, inſtead of <hi>Water</hi> gives her a Bottle <hi>of Milk,</hi> yea he brings forth <hi>Butter in a Lordly diſh!</hi> treats her at the <hi>Kindeſt</hi> rate, and that for four whole Months. And now let the <hi>moſt indulgent</hi> Parent judge, whether this was <hi>a juſt</hi> dealing with this <hi>Strumpet,</hi> whoſe Crime God had long before <hi>Sentenced with Death,</hi> Lev. 20.10.

For ought I know, had her Father been more ſevere, he might have prevented her farther defiling, and Murder by the <hi>filthy Gibeathites, Judg.</hi> 19.25, 28.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>old Eli.</hi> Did he <hi>Know</hi> all this? 'Tis true, <hi>eſpecially of Great men,</hi> that they, uſually, are the <hi>very laſt,</hi> that are informed of the Evil of their own Houſe: but yet as to <hi>Eli,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It could not probably be, but when all <hi>Iſrael rang</hi> of the lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Sons, <hi>he only ſhould be ignorant of it.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Or,</hi> if He knew it not, <hi>can his Ignorance be excus'd?</hi> It being not an Ignorance <hi>merae privatis,</hi> but <hi>pravae diſpoſitionis:</hi> for where ſhould <hi>Eli</hi> have been but in the <hi>Temple?</hi> either for <hi>action</hi> or <hi>overſight?</hi> The very <hi>preſence</hi> of the Prieſt keeps <hi>Gods Houſe</hi> in order. 'Twas his grand duty <hi>carefully to inſpect</hi> them, at leaſt <hi>diligently</hi> to enquire after the <hi>due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> of Gods Ordinances, and a juſt and ſeaſonable <hi>rebuke,</hi> and <hi>reſtraint</hi> might have happily <hi>prevented</hi> this extremity and heighth of <hi>prodigious debauchery.</hi> Nothing but Age can plead and <hi>apologize</hi> for <hi>Eli,</hi> that he was not the <hi>firſt</hi> Accuſer of theſe his <hi>Sons</hi> will you call them, or <hi>monſters.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now, when their Enormities come to be the <hi>cry</hi> of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when it <hi>thunders,</hi> and he muſt <hi>perforce</hi> hear it, and this loud clap muſt of <hi>neceſſity</hi> pierce not his <hi>ears</hi> only, but his <hi>heart,</hi> bowels, <hi>conſcience.</hi> But with what holy fervour, <hi>zeal,</hi> juſtice, <hi>indignation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Was it, <hi>as with Judah,</hi> when 'twas told him, <hi>Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath playd the harlot;</hi> bring her forth, and let her <hi>be burnt? Gen.</hi> 38.24. * Theſe my Sons are Adulterers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or <hi>as the Parents of the ſtubborn and rebellious Son,</hi> lay hold of them and carry them forth <hi>to the Elders of the City,</hi> and ſay to the Elders of the City: Theſe my Sons are <hi>ſtubborn,</hi> and <hi>rebellious,</hi> they have not, will not obey my voice, let them be <hi>ſtoned to death.</hi> So God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18. to 22. Thus, even thus, ſhould <hi>Eli,</hi> who was not only <hi>the chief Prieſt,</hi> but the <hi>ſupreme Judge</hi> of <hi>Iſrael, impartially</hi> have judged his own corrupted fleſh; and never could he have offer'd a <hi>more pleaſing</hi> Sacrifice, than the corrupt <hi>gore blood</hi> of ſo wicked Sons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doubtleſs <hi>Eli</hi> knew full well, that <hi>'Twas in vain to rebuke thoſe ſins abroad, which we tolerate at home:</hi> That that man makes himſelf a <hi>ridicule,</hi> that leaves his <hi>own</hi> houſe on <hi>fire,</hi> and runs to <hi>quench</hi> his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and quitting his own Family <hi>infected</hi> with the Plague, haſtens to the <hi>cure</hi> of his Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We find, this good <hi>Eli, as old as he was,</hi> could be <hi>tart,</hi> and ſharp enough to another, to godly, mourning, praying <hi>Hannah,</hi> when he thought only, ſhe had been <hi>drunk</hi> before the Lord, upon but the <hi>bare ſuſpicion</hi> of a ſin: <hi>How long wilt thou be</hi> drunken? <hi>put away thy wine from thee;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13, 14. 'Tis true, his reproof aroſe from <hi>miſpriſion,</hi> but that miſpriſion ſprang from <hi>zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But what now? In the Caſe before us, you cannot but expect to

For ſatisfaction, read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22. to 26. <hi>Now Eli was very old, and heard All that his Sons did unto all Iſrael, and how they lay with the women, that aſſembled at the door of the Congregation: and he ſaid unto them:</hi> To <hi>ſhame,</hi> To Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, To <hi>hell</hi> with them, To the <hi>Worm</hi> that dies not, To the <hi>fire</hi> that never ſhall be quenched! Was this his Sentence? No, no. But <hi>to amazement;</hi> Hear what he ſays:</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He ſaid unto them, Why do ye ſuch things, for I hear of your Evil dealings by all this People?</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Nay, my Sons, for it is no good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that I hear, ye make the Lords People to trangreſs.</hi> 25. <hi>If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him, but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See here Indulgence to a <hi>prodigy;</hi> to the notorious Crimes of his Wicked Sons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How ſoon do we find the caſe alter'd!</hi> to <hi>Hannah</hi> he ſpake as an <hi>Holy</hi> Prieſt, a juſt Judge; to theſe, as a <hi>fond</hi> indulgent Father. If <hi>corrupt</hi> nature be allow'd to ſpeak in Judgement, and to make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence not of Crimes, but <hi>Criminals;</hi> not of <hi>Sins,</hi> but <hi>Offenders,</hi> the Scales will not be <hi>Equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Had theſe wretches but <hi>a little ſlack'd</hi> their duty, or heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly omitted ſome <hi>rites</hi> of the Sacrifices, this Cenſure had not been <hi>ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But, to puniſh the <hi>thefts,</hi> rapines, <hi>ſacriledges,</hi> Adulteryes of his Sons with <hi>a meer Why do you</hi> ſo; was no other than to <hi>ſhave that</hi> head, that deſerved the <hi>Ax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As</hi> it is with <hi>Ill humours;</hi> A weak doſe doth but <hi>irritate,</hi> and anger them, not <hi>purge</hi> them out: ſo it fares with habituated Sins, and ſo it did here; <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>They hearkned not to the voice of their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An eaſie reproof doth but encourage wickedneſs,</hi> and makes it think it ſelf ſo ſlight, as that Cenſure imports. Nay, a vehement reproof, if no more; to a <hi>capital Evil</hi> is, at moſt, but like a <hi>ſmart Shower</hi> to a ripe Field, which <hi>only layes</hi> that Corn, which is worthy of a <hi>Sickle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a breach of Juſtice, not to proportion the Puniſhment to the Offence; to <hi>Whip a</hi> man for <hi>murther;</hi> to puniſh the <hi>purſe</hi> only, for <hi>inceſt;</hi> to burn <hi>Treaſon</hi> in the hand; to award the <hi>Stocks</hi> to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary;</hi> to lay on the <hi>Verge,</hi> where the Ax or <hi>Gibbet</hi> are deſerv'd; is to <hi>patronize</hi> Evil, inſtead of <hi>avenging</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the Childrens <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and the Fathers <hi>Indulgence.</hi> But is there not a <hi>Melius inquirendum</hi> in the caſe? Yes, yes. From a fond, and <hi>partial</hi> Bar, to a ſtrict, and <hi>impartial</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>

            <p>Poor <hi>Eli</hi> could not have deviſed, or ſtudied a more <hi>compendious,</hi> and effectual <hi>Way,</hi> to have <hi>plagued</hi> himſelf, his Houſe, his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; than by this his <hi>ſinful kindneſs</hi> to his Childrens Sins.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Meſſenger of God!</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.27. to the end.

            <p>The Love of our Childrens <hi>Souls,</hi> is the very <hi>Soul,</hi> and Spirit, and <hi>Elixir</hi> of True parental Love.

            <p n="2">2. Love your Children, truly, tenderly, <hi>but yet take heed that you do not over-love them.</hi> But when is that?

Do you not often think, you love God enough,</hi> and when, your Child moſt, <hi>yet but enough, nay never enough:</hi> your head, <hi>heart,</hi> hand, <hi>purſe,</hi> mandrakes, five <hi>meſſes,</hi> breaſts, <hi>bowels;</hi> All, but little enough, <hi>too little</hi> for your Child, <hi>your Idol;</hi> is it ſo as to your God?

The Emblem of ſuch Perſons is ingeniouſly drawn from the Ape, the uglieſt (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves) of Creatures, the moſt miſchievous in his Pranks, uſeleſs and ſaucy: And are ſuch worthy to be loved? How comely a ſight do you think an ill ſhap't Ape, grinning on his own Features in a flattering Glaſs, would be? Such is the man that loves to ſee himſelf in Flattery's Mirrour. How glorious was <hi>Alexander M.</hi> while he rejected Fawners!

There was more than ordinary in <hi>Herod,</hi> which gave him the Name of <hi>Great,</hi> but when he over-loved the Praiſe of men, God left him a Monument and Warning to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, giving up ſo contemptible a Slave of his own vain-glory, to the moſt contemptible, loathſome and ſhameful death: Lice bred in his own Bowels, deſtroy his Body, as the Vermin of Self-love, and Self-admiring reflections had deſtroy'd his Mind. Look firſt on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of a Self-admirer, next on the beauty of a ſelf-denying Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and this will cure this diſtemper.

            <p>But did Flatterers find ſuch great ones Ears ſtopt, and their minds fortifi'd againſt, or alienated from their flatteries, the danger were not conſiderable. The Flatterer can but attempt, our Love to the flattery gives the ſucceſs: the Head and Shaft of the Arrow cannot fly to endanger the Eagle, 'twas his own Feathers that contributed to his Wound and Death: Scarce a City, Family, or Perſon whoſe Calamities were fit to be noted in the World, but you may find ſome Paraſites, ſome cloſe undermining Flatterers charged as a great occaſion of thoſe Calamities, and the love, affection and delight thoſe Flaterers found, much more the Cauſe of thoſe fatal Calamities. <hi>Ahab</hi> fell more by his own Love of Flattery, than by the Artifices of the Son of <hi>Chenaanah</hi> and his Accomplices, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. So in the Parable, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.12, 16. the Wall fell, for the Builders built it with untemper'd Morter, and the People loved to ſee the building thus go forward: Scarce one that diſlik't it, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. obſerveth, the conſequence of which is, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>have poured mine Indignation upon them, I have conſumed them with the fire of my wrath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When Prophets propheſie falſely, and Prieſts bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it ſo: what will you do in the end thereof?</hi> Jer. 5.31.

This he did know was the way to prevent Love of Flatteries and Flatterers, to keep them out of his preſence.

It is not unfitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to thoſe diſtempers which increaſe on us by our Indulgence.

He will never leſſen truth to magnifie any, he will never intrench on Juſtice to gratifie any; he is a God of Truth and Righteouſneſs, what your Good or Evil is he will impartially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and abhorreth ſuch who love a Lye, and unrighteouſneſs, in their valuing of themſelves and Actions; will it be good that God ſhould ſearch you out?<note n="†" place="margin">Quod ſi divina quaedam res ſit veritas ex qua cenfonte Diis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter ac homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omnia bona preficiſcuntur, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum ne adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator Diis omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſit hoſtis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ex <hi>Plutarcho Lud.

Get ſuch a prevailing degree of Generous and pure Love to all that is Good, and ſuch a degree of Hatred unto Evil, that you may want neither the good word of men to be a ſpurr to doing Good, nor the ſharp Reproofs of men to reſtrain from evil; who hateth evil, will not need any one ſhould put a colour on it to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the apparent evil: We are glad that what we hate appears ſo evil, that it juſtifies our Hatred.

Get that frame of Heart <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> and then you are ſafe from this Diſeaſe: And to make the Cure compleat, add that Pure, Generous, Univerſal and Divine Love of Good, for its own ſake, that will account it a rich Recompence, and Praiſe enough to have done it: There will be little need of mans juſt Praiſes; where our Love to doing Good is ſet on it for its own ſake, there will need none of the undue Praiſes of any: None need praiſe the Perſon of <hi>Rachel</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> he would have ſcorn'd the Flatteries of any who ſhould have leſſen'd her real Lovelineſs by falſe Colours: How ſhould we diſdain the labour, and condemn the folly of a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that would perſwade us he could add Lovelineſs to the light of a Glorious Morning? Open your eyes, ye Lovers of Virtue, look on all her Daughters, they are all Glorious; if any are Veil'd, 'tis becauſe you cannot bear the luſtre of their Excellency: Awake ye dreaming Mortals, you'l ſee enough in Naked Virtue to fall in Love with it; (as all would, if they ſaw it, according to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Judgment.) They are weak Stomachs that muſt be allur'd by ſuperadded Sauces to eat of Good Viands, there is no need of them where Food is loved, and the Appetite in right order: ſo here, when you Love Good for the Goodneſs that is in it, you'l deſire Flatterers to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear their labour, leſt they marr what you Love, by adding of their own, which you hate and ſuſpect. When God would put us in a ſure way of keeping his Commandements, and perſevering in a Praiſe-worthy Life, he does direct us to encourage our ſelves by the large Praiſes of men, but Commands we ſhould Love his Law with all our Heart: This will Cure indeed.</p>

               <hi>ſave thy ſelf from the guilt of other mens Sins</hi> and <hi>Ruine,</hi> if thou be faithful in the Miniſtry. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.9. <hi>Thou haſt delivered</hi> (or <hi>ſaved) thy Soul,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the Prophet in the caſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſſeful Faithfulneſs. So <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 18.6. <hi>I am clean, your blood be upon your own heads;</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.26, 27. <hi>I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God.</hi> Every Miniſter pledgeth his Soul to God, that he ſhall be a faithful Servant; and he that is ſuch, may freely take up his Stake, whatever his Succeſs on others be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Faithfulneſs and Painfulneſs in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes a mans own Salvation, in ſo far as <hi>the work of Chriſtianity is woven in with the right diſcharge of the Office of the Miniſtry.</hi> Many
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42587:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> Miniſters can ſay, that if they had not been Miniſters, they had in all appearance loſt their Souls. The Subject of the Miniſters work is the ſame with that of a Chriſtian's; and above all men ſhould he be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Heart and Intentions, that all be pure and ſpiritual: No man in any work he is called to, is under ſo ſtrict a neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the influence and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, both for Gifts and Grace. And are not all theſe great helps unto our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Second advantage is, <hi>thou ſhalt ſave them that hear thee.</hi> There is little hope of that mans being uſefull to ſave others, that minds not his own Salvation: And therefore the Apoſtle puts them in this order, <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> and then, <hi>them that hear thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This deſcription of the People, <hi>them that hear thee,</hi> ſaith, that the principal work of a Miniſter is Preaching; and the principal benefit People have by them, is to hear the Lords Word from them; though there be a <hi>ſeeing (i. e.</hi> of their holy Converſation) that is alſo uſeful, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. But the Apoſtle knew no ſuch Miniſters as were only to be ſeen in worldly Pomp and Grandeur, and ſeldom or never heard Preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt ſave them:</hi> The great End of both Preaching and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is Salvation; and if Salvation were more deſign'd by Preachers and Hearers, it would be more frequently the effect of the action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt ſave them.</hi> Thou ſhalt by the Lords bleſſing on thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry be ſucceſſeful in converting Sinners, and in building up of Saints in Holineſs and Faith unto Salvation. Not that Miniſters are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able by all their Endeavours to carry on this great End; they are only Gods Tools and Inſtruments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. Concerning this</p>
            <p n="1">1. We find that the Lord hath <hi>appointed this great Ordinance of the Goſpel-Miniſtry for this end,</hi> the Saving of men. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. It is <hi>through their Word that men believe,</hi> Joh. 17.20. And Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Means, declares both it to be uſefull, and the End to be hopefull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath alſo <hi>given many Promiſes of his preſence, bleſſing and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> to follow and attend them whom he ſends on this great Errand. <hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt calling of the Apoſtles had this Promiſe in it, <hi>I will make you Fiſhers of men;</hi> which not only declared what that Imployment was he call'd them unto, but it aſſur'd them of ſucceſs in it. At his leaving of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. he promiſed <hi>to be with them unto the End of the World;</hi> and this Promiſe is as good to us as it was to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath alſo <hi>revealed much of his Mind about Miniſters Duty</hi> in order to this end of Saving men. This alſo makes the End more hopefull.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We find that the <hi>Lord doth qualifie and fit them whom he makes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful.</hi> He <hi>makes men able Miniſters of the New Teſtament,</hi> the Word of Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. And ſtill according to the ſucceſs the Lord
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42587:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath a mind to bleſs a man with, gifts and qualifications and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are proportionably given. The Apoſtles that had the greateſt Harveſt to gather in, were made the ſtrongeſt Labourers; and though in a far inferiour degree, the ſame method is obſerved by the Lord in dealing with and by ordinary Miniſters. It's true, that alwayes the moſt able and learned Miniſters are not moſt ſucceſſeful; yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the moſt skilfull Labourers are moſt bleſſed: Neither are the moſt Learned and able men for parts, moſt fit and skilful in dealing with Souls at all times.</p>
            <p>Now having opened the words, we ſhall return to the Queſtion to be reſolved, <hi>By what means may Miniſters beſt win Souls?</hi> In ſpeaking to which, I ſhall firſt ſhew, What this Text ſaith unto this purpoſe. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. And then give ſome further account thereof from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. And apply it both to Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What this Text ſpeaks about this matter. It looks two wayes upon this Queſtion. 1. It gives a direct Anſwer unto it; and points forth Duty. 2. It gives an encouraging Promiſe of the good Effect and Fruit of the diſcharge of the Duty. I ſhall carry on both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf.</hi> Wouldſt thou be a ſaved and ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter, take heed unto thy ſelf. Such Warnings imply alwayes a Caſe of difficulty and danger wherein he is that gets them.</p>
            <p>Take heed unto thy ſelf in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed <hi>that thou be a ſound and ſincere Believer.</hi> The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſincere Godlineſs in a Miniſter, is written in the deep wounds that the Church of Chriſt hath received by the hands of ungodly Miniſters. It hath been made a queſtion, Whether an ungodly Man can be a Miniſter; but it is none, That ſuch men are in a moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Depart from me,</hi> not becauſe you ran unſent, or preach'd Error inſtead of Truth, or preached poorly and meanly, (all great ſins in themſelves) but becauſe <hi>you work iniquity,</hi> the uſual expreſſion of intire ungodlineſs. What uſe the Lord may make of the Gifts (for great Gifts he gives to the worſt of men) of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, even in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, is one of his deep Paths. But no man can reaſonably imagine, that a walker in the way to Hell, can be a fit and uſefull Guide to them that mind to go to Heaven. If a man would have peace in his Conſcience, and ſucceſs in his work of the Miniſtry, let him take good heed to this, that he be a ſound Chriſtian. There is a ſpecial difficulty for a Miniſter to know his Grace; Gifts and Grace have deceived many with their likeneſs, although the difference be great both in it ſelf, and to an enlightened Eye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed to thy ſelf, that thou <hi>be a called and ſent Miniſter.</hi> This is of great importance as to Succeſs. He that can ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt ſent me,</hi> may boldly adde, <hi>Lord, go with me, and bleſs me.</hi> It is good when a man is ſerious in this Inquiry. It is to be feared that many run, and never ask this Queſtion; ſo is it ſeen in their ſpeed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42587:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſucceſs. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>I ſent them not, therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all,</hi> is a ſtanding rule to this day.</p>
            <p>Theſe things if found, may ſerve to ſatisfie a Miniſters Conſcience, that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſent him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Heart <hi>be filled with a ſingle deſire after the great end of the Miniſtry,</hi> the Glory of God in the Salvation of men. Every work that God calls a man to, he makes the End of it amiable. This deſire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attends mens firſt Converſion; <hi>Paul</hi> was called to be a Saint and an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> at once, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and ſo have many been called to be Saints and Miniſters together. If it be not ſo, yet this is found with him that Chriſt calls, that when he is moſt ſpiritual and ſerious, when his Heart is moſt under the impreſſions of Holineſs, and he is neareſt to God in Communion with him: Then are ſuch deſires after the ſerving of Jeſus Chriſt in the Miniſtry, moſt powerful. And the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his deſire is alſo to be examined, and when it's found, it addes greatly to a Mans peace: When his Heart bears him witneſs, that it is neither Riches, nor Honour, nor Eaſe, nor the Applauſe of men, that he ſeeks after, but ſingly Chriſts Honour in the ſaving of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It helps to clear a mans Call, that there hath been a <hi>conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diligence in all the Means</hi> of attaining fitneſs for this great work. That Love to the End, that doth not direct and determine unto the uſe of the appointed Means, may juſtly be ſuſpected as irregular, and not flowing from the Holy Ghoſt. Even extraordinary Officers ſeem not to have been above the uſe of ordinary Means. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. Old dying <hi>Paul</hi> ſends for his Books and Papers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>competent fitneſs</hi> for the work of the Miniſtry, is another proof of a mans Call to it. The Lord calls no man to a work, for which he doth not qualifie. Though a ſincere humble man (as all Miniſters ſhould be) may and ſhould think little of any meaſure he hath, whether compared with the greater meaſures of others, or conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with regard unto the weight and worth of the work; yet there muſt be ſome confidence as to his Competency, for clearing a mans Call. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. What this Competency is, is not eaſie at all times to determine. Singular Neceſſities of the Church may extend or intend this matter, of competent Fitneſs: But in general there muſt be 1. A competent Knowledge of Goſpel-Myſteries. 2. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Ability of Utterance to the Edifying of others. This is <hi>apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Teach,</hi> required of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. That a Miniſter be <hi>able by ſound Doctrine to exhort, and to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſavour of a mans Miniſtry on the Hearts and Conſciences of others,</hi> both Miniſters and People, helps much to clear a mans Call. So that indeed ordinarily a man can never be ſo well confirmed in the Faith of his being called of God, untill he make ſome Eſſay in this work. Deacons muſt firſt be proved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. much more Miniſters. A ſingle Teſtimony given by Miniſters and Chriſtians, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42587:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Word diſpenſed by the Man is ſavoury, and hath Effect on the Conſcience, is a great Confirmation; eſpecially if ſound Converſion of ſome follow his Labours. That is indeed a Seal of his Miniſtry; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed unto thy ſelf, <hi>that thou be a lively thriving Chriſtian.</hi> See that all thy Religion run not in the Channel of thy Employment. It is found by Experience, that as it fares with a Miniſter in the frame of his Heart, and thriving of the work of God in his Soul, ſo doth it fare with his Miniſtry both in its vigor and effects. A carnal frame, a dead heart, and a looſe walk, makes cold and unprofitable Preaching. And how common is it for Miniſters to neglect their own Vineyard? When we read the Word, we read it as Miniſters, to know what we ſhould <hi>teach,</hi> rather than what we ſhould <hi>learn</hi> as Chriſtians. Unleſs there be great heed taken, it will be found, that our Miniſtry and Labour therein, may eat out the Life of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; not that there is any diſcord betwixt them, but rather a friendly Harmony, when each hath its place and reſpect. The honeſt Believer meditates that he may excite his Grace; and Miniſters too often meditate only to increaſe their Gifts. When we Preach, the ſincere Hearer drinks in the Word, and it may be we ſeldom mix Faith with it, to grow thereby. O how hard is it to be a Miniſter and a Chriſtian in ſome of theſe acts! We are ſtill converſant about the things of God; it is our ſtudy all the Week long: This is our great advantage; but take heed to thy ſelf, leſt ordinary medling with Divine things, bring on an ordinary and indifferent impreſſion of them; and then their Fruit to thee, and thy benefit by them, is almoſt gone, and hardly recovered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take heed unto thy ſelf in reference <hi>to all the Trials and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations thou mayeſt meet with.</hi> Be on your guard, <hi>watch in all things,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. No men are ſhot at more by Satan than Miniſters, and he triumphs not more over the foyls of any, than theirs. And Chriſt is liberal in his warnings of Dangers, and in his Promiſes of help in them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Second word in the Text, to this purpoſe of directing Miniſters how to be uſeful to others, is, <hi>Take heed unto thy Doctrine.</hi> Art thou a Miniſter, thou muſt be a Preacher; an unpreaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is a ſort of contradiction. Yea every ſort of Preaching is not enough; thou muſt take heed unto thy Doctrine what it is.</p>
            <p>Here is warrant for Studying what we are to teach, and what we have taught People. But the great matter is to take heed, or ſtudy aright. Students commonly need little direction about ordinary ſtudy. But concerning the Doctrine, I ſhall entreat to take heed unto it in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed unto thy Doctrine, that it be <hi>a divine Truth: Let a man ſpeak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.11. And therefore it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that Miniſters be well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures. A bad token of the Temper of that man that reliſhes any Book more than
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42587:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Word of God. The World is full of Books written on pretence and deſign to explain the Scriptures, and mens Studies are full of them; there is alſo a Bleſſing in them, and good uſe to be made of them. But alſo a bad uſe is made of them: Many Miniſters have found that they have preached better and to more profit to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they got their Sermon by Meditation on the Word and Prayer, than by turning over many Authors. From this neglect of the Word alſo comes a great many Doctrines, that are learn'd by Man, and borrowed from Philoſophy; which though they may have ſome Truth in them, yet ſince it is divine Truth that a Miniſter ſhould bring forth to the People, he ſhould not reſt on ſuch low things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed unto thy Doctrine, that <hi>it be plain, and ſuited to the capacity of the hearers.</hi> Learned Preaching (as it is called) is a Vanity, pleaſing principally to ſuch as neither deſign nor deſire Edification. True godly Learning conſiſts in preaching Plainly, and therein is no no ſmall difficulty. Two things would help to plain Preaching. 1. Clearneſs of Knowledge. The alledged depth of our Doctrine often proceeds from our own darkneſs. 2. Humility and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal. We muſt not ſeek our ſelves nor the Applauſe of men, but Gods glory and mens Salvation. It is found that the holieſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preach moſt plainly, and the plaineſt Preachers are moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed unto thy Doctrine, <hi>that it be grave, and ſolid, and weighty. Sound Speech that cannot be condemned,</hi> Tit. 2.8. Deep and weighty Impreſſions of the things of God upon a mans own Heart, would greatly advance this. A Miniſters Spirit is known in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or lightneſs of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But now we come to the ſecond thing propoſed, to give ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Queſtion from other things in the Word.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall 1. Shew ſome things that muſt be laid to heart about the End, the <hi>ſaving of Souls.</hi> 2. And then ſhall give ſome advice about the Means.</p>
            <p n="1">1. About the End, the <hi>winning of Souls.</hi> This is to bring them to God; it is not to win them to us, or to engage them into a Party, or to the eſpouſal of ſome Opinions and Practices, ſuppoſing them to be never ſo right and conſonant to the Word of God. But the winning of them is, to bring them out of Nature into a ſtate of Grace, that they may be fitted for, and in due time admitted into everlaſting Glory.</p>
            <p>Concerning which great End, theſe few things ſhould be laid deeply
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42587:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> to heart by all that would ſerve the Lord in being inſtrumental in reaching it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>exceeding height and excellency of this End</hi> is to be laid to heart. It is a wonder of condeſcendence, that the Lord will make uſe of men in promoting it. To be workers together with God in ſo great a buſineſs, is no ſmall honour. The great value of mens Souls, the greatneſs of the miſery they are delivered from, and of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they are advanced to, with the manifold Glory of God ſhining in all, makes the work of ſaving men great and excellent. Preaching the Goſpel and ſuffering for it, are Services that Angels are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in. Mean and low thoughts of the great End of the Miniſtry, as they are diſſonant from Truth, are alſo great hinderances of due endeavours after the attaining the End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>great difficulty of ſaving Souls</hi> muſt be laid to heart. The difficulty is undoubted. To attempt it, is to offer violence to mens corrupt Natures, and a ſtorming of Hell it ſelf, whoſe Captives all ſinners are. Unleſs this difficulty be laid to heart, Miniſters will be confident of their own ſtrength, and ſo miſcarry and be unfruitfull. Whoever proſpers in winning Souls, is firſt convinc'd that it is the Arm of Jehovah only can do the work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The duty of winning Souls</hi> muſt be laid to heart by Miniſters. That it is their principal work, and they are under many Commands to endeavour it. It's a fault to look on Fruit only as a reward of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; ſo it is indeed and a gracious one; but it ſhould be ſo mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the End we would ſtrive for, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28, 29. which when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is ſtill to His Praiſe; yet moſt commonly when it is miſſing, it is to our reproach and danger, when it is (as alas! it's often) through our default.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>great advantage there is to the Labourer by his ſucceſs,</hi> is to be pondered. Great is the gain by one Soul; he <hi>that winneth Souls</hi> is happy as well as <hi>wiſe, Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. Won Souls are a Miniſters <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Joy, Phil.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt.</hi> How far is this account above all others that a man can give of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? Theſe things fix'd upon the Heart, would enliven us in all endeavours to attain this excellent End.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For advice about the Means; I ſhall adde theſe few, beſides what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let Miniſters, if they would win Souls, <hi>procure and retain amongſt the People, a perſwaſion of their being ſent of God;</hi> that they are Chriſts Miniſters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. It is not confident aſſerting of it, nor juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42587:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> the lawfulneſs of our Eccleſiaſtical Calling, though there be ſome uſe of theſe things at ſome times: But it is ability, painfulneſs, faithfulneſs, humility and ſelf-denyal, and in a word, conformity to our Lord Jeſus in his Miniſtry, that will conſtrain People to ſay and think that we are ſent of God. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> comes with this Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>A teacher come from God.</hi> It is certain, that theſe thoughts in people further the reception of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ye received me as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let Miniſters, if they would win Souls, purchaſe and maintain <hi>the Peoples Love to their Perſons.</hi> And this is beſt done by loving of them, and dealing lovingly and patiently with them. There ſhould be <hi>no ſtriving</hi> with them, eſpecially about worldly things; yea <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them that oppoſe themſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25, 26. It is of great advantage to have their Love; how carefully doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſue for it, in ſeveral Epiſtles, and condeſcend to entreat and make Apologies, when indeed he had not wrong'd them, but they only did imagine he had wrong'd them! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It would further the winning of Souls, <hi>to deal particularly and perſonally with them.</hi> Not alwayes nor altogether in publick, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21. Great fruit hath conſtantly followed the conſcientious diſcharge of this duty. The ſetting of it up in <hi>Geneva,</hi> did produce incredible Fruits of Piety, as <hi>Calvin</hi> reports: when the Miniſters and ſome of the Elders went from Houſe to Houſe, and dealt particularly with the Peoples Conſciences. And we are not without many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Fruit of this mean, in our own time, and in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Bleſſed be the Lord for the Labourers and their ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Miniſters <hi>muſt Pray much,</hi> if they would be ſucceſſeful. The Apoſtles ſpent their time this way, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. Yea, our Lord Jeſus preached all day, and continued all night alone in Prayer to God. Miniſters ſhould be much in Prayer. They uſe to reckon how many hours they ſpend in Reading and Study; it were far better both with our ſelves and the Church of God, if more time were ſpent in Prayer. <hi>Luthers</hi> ſpending three hours daily in ſecret Prayer; <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> ſtudying on his knees, and other inſtances of men in our time, are talk'd of rather than imitated. Miniſters ſhould pray much for themſelves, for they have Corruptions like other men, and have Temptations that none but Miniſters are aſſaulted with. They ſhould pray for their Meſſage. How ſweet and eaſie is it for a Miniſter (and likely it is to be the more profitable to the People) to bring forth that Scripture as Food to the Souls of his People, that he hath got opened to his own Heart by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, in the exerciſe of Faith and Love in Prayer. A Miniſter ſhould pray for the Bleſſing on the Word; and he ſhould be much in ſeeking God
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42587:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> particularly for the People. It may be this may be the reaſon why ſome Miniſters of meaner Gifts and Parts are more ſucceſſeful than ſome that are far above them in abilities; not becauſe they preach better, ſo much as becauſe they pray more. Many good Sermons are loſt, for lack of much Prayer in Study.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Miniſtry of the Word is the main inſtrument for winning Souls, I ſhall therefore adde ſomewhat more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning this; and that both as to the matter and manner of Preaching.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Subject-matter of Goſpel Preaching it is determined by the Apoſtle expreſſely, to be <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. Two things Miniſters have to do about Him, in preaching Him to them that are without. 1. To <hi>ſet him forth</hi> to People, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. to paint him in his Love, Excellency, and ability to ſave. 2. To <hi>offer</hi> him unto them freely, fully, without any limitation as to Sinners or their ſinful State. And then <hi>Chriſts Laws or Will</hi> to be publiſhed to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him, and are his, for the Rule of their walk, and <hi>his promiſes</hi> for the meaſure and foundation of all their hopes and Expectations, and <hi>his Grace and fulneſs</hi> for their ſupply in every caſe, till they be brought to Heaven. This was the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, that remained but a little while in the Chriſtian Church; for Ceremonies amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> and ſinful mixtures of vain Philoſophy amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did by degrees ſo corrupt the Goſpel, that the Myſtery of Iniquity ripened in the production of Antichriſt. It was a ſad Obſervation of the Fourth Century, that it became a matter of Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to be a Chriſtian: The meaning was, that too much weight was laid on Notions and matter of Opinion; and leſs regard had unto the ſoundneſs of the Heart, and Holineſs of the Life. In the beginning of the Reformation from Popery, the Worthies whom God raiſed up in ſeveral Countreys, did excellently in retrieving the Simplicity of the Goſpel, from the Popiſh mixtures; but that good work took a ſtand quickly, and is on the declining greatly. How little of Jeſus Chriſt is there in ſome Pulpits! It is ſeen as to ſucceſs, that whatever the Law doth in alarming Sinners, it is ſtill the Goſpel voice that is the Key that opens the Heart to Jeſus Chriſt: Would Miniſters win Souls? let them have more of Jeſus Chriſt in their dealing with men, and leſs of other things that never profit them that are exerciſed therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the manner of ſucceſſeful Preaching, I ſhall give it in a Negative and Poſitive from theſe two places: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. &amp; 2. 1.—4. What this negative diſowns, is our inquiry: The Words are full; for <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel; not with wiſdom of Words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none

I ſhall only inſtance in things that this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural Negative doth check and reprove in the way of Preaching.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>eſtabliſhing and advancing of Divine Truth upon the Foundation of humane Reaſon.</hi> As if there were ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſufficiency in thoſe methods and arguments of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on mens Conſciences, that the Holy Ghoſt preſcribes. The great Foundation of all a Miniſter hath to ſay, is, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and a grave declaring of the Teſtimony of God in this matter, is Miniſters Duty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1. and will have more Authority on mens Conſciences than many humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. There is a <hi>rational Preaching</hi> (as it is called) wherein men do not ſatisfie themſelves to make uſe of Reaſon as a Tool and Inſtrument (and then its uſe is excellent,) but will eſtabliſh it as a Judge and Dictator in all Divine matters and Truth; and ſo in effect turn all their Preaching into little better things than the Lectures of the Philoſophers of old, ſave that the poor Pagans were more ſincere in their Morals, and ſerious in delivering their Opinions.</p>
            <p>Let a Miniſter therefore ſtill think with himſelf, that a plain Scripture Teſtimony is his main argument; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly let him uſe it. When he teacheth Philoſophy, and when he teacheth men the Will of God about Salvation, he is in diſtinct Provinces, and his management of his work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhould be very different.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to Preach with <hi>excellency of Speech,</hi> and words of <hi>mans Wiſdom,</hi> when men <hi>think to reach</hi> the Goſpel-end <hi>on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by force of even ſpiritual reaſon and perſwaſion.</hi> This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thought riſeth in ſome from an imagination that <hi>moral ſuaſion</hi> is all that is needfull for converting a Sinner; and in ſome this thought riſes on a better account; the Light of the Glory of God in the Goſpel ſhines ſo brightly in upon their own Hearts, that they fall into this Conceit, That no man can ſtand before that Light which they can hold forth. <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s miſtake at firſt, till Experience made him wiſer.

We may obſerve from Church-Hiſtory, that ſtill as Soundneſs of Doctrine and the Power of Godlineſs decayed in the Church, the Vanity of an affected way of ſpeaking and writing of Divine things came in. Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Fathers, Latine and Languages are pitiful Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto Preaching, if a man deſign Converſion and Soul-edification. And yet more deſpicable are all playing on words, Jinglings and Cadencies (which things are in all the Rules of true Eloquence juſtly exploded) and yet ſome men reckon much on them.

            <p>To conclude: You that are Miniſters, ſuffer a Word of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Men, Brethren and Fathers, you are called to an high and holy Calling; your Work is full of Danger, full of Duty, and full of Mercy. You are called to the <hi>winning of Souls,</hi> an Employment near a-kin unto our Lords work, the <hi>ſaving of Souls;</hi> and the nearer your ſpirits be in conformity to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper and frame, the fitter you are for, and the more fruitfull you ſhall be in your work. None of you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the begun departure of our Glory, and the daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of its departure, and the ſad appearances of the Lords being about to leave us utterly. Should not theſe Signs of the times rowſe up Miniſters unto greater ſeriouſneſs? What can be the reaſon of this ſad Obſervation, that when formerly a few Lights raiſed up in the Nation, did ſhine ſo, as to ſcatter and diſpell the darkneſs of Popery in a little time; yet now when there are more, and more Learned men amongſt us, yet the Darkneſs comes on apace? Is it not becauſe they were men <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Power;</hi> and many of us are only filled with Light and Knowledge, and inefficacious Notions of Gods Truth? Doth not always the Spirit of the Miniſters propagate it ſelf amongſt the People? A lively Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and lively Chriſtians. Therefore be ſerious at heart, believe and ſo ſpeak, feel and ſo ſpeak, and as you teach ſo doe, and then People will feel what you ſay, and obey the Word of God.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, for People: It is not unfit that you ſhould hear of Miniſters Work, and Duty, and Difficulties; you ſee that all is of your Concernment: All things are for your ſakes, as the Apoſtle in another caſe.</p>
            <p>Then only I intreat you, 1. <hi>Pity us.</hi> We are not Angels, but men of like Paſſions with your ſelves. Be fuller of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than of Cenſure: We have all that you have to do about the ſaving of our own Souls, and a great Work beſides, about the ſaving of yours. We have all your difficulties as Chriſtians, and ſome that you are not acquainted with, that are only Miniſters Temptations and Tryals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Help us in our Work.</hi> If you can do any thing, help us in the work of Winning Souls. What can we do, ſay you? O! a great deal: Be but won to Chriſt, and we are made
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42587:111"/> Make haſte to Heaven, that you and we may meet joyfully before the Throne of God and the Lamb.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pray for us.</hi> How often and how earneſtly doth <hi>Paul</hi> begg the Prayers of the Churches! and if he did ſo, much more ſhould we begg them, and you grant them, for our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and Weakneſſes are greater than his. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Finally, Brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified, even as it is with you; and that we may be delivered from unreaſonable and wicked men, for all men have not Faith.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen falſe Worſhip had prevailed in the Church of old, unto its Ruine, God ſhewed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it unto his Prophet, under the name and appearance of a <hi>Chamber of Imagery,</hi> Ezek. 8.11, 12. For therein were pourtraied all the Abomination wherewith the Worſhip of God was defiled, and Religion corrupted.</p>
            <p>Things relating unto Divine Truth and Worſhip, have had again the ſame event in the world, eſpecially in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And my preſent Deſign is to take a view of the <hi>Chambers of their Imagery,</hi> and to ſhew what was the occaſion, and what were the Means of their Erection; and in them we ſhall ſee all the <hi>Abomination</hi> wherewith the Divine Worſhip of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42587:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> Goſpel hath been corrupted, and Chriſtian Religion ruined.</p>
            <p>Unto this end it will be neceſſary to lay down ſome ſuch Principles of Sacred. Truth, as will demonſtrate and evince the Grounds and Cauſes of that Transformation of the Subſtance and Power of Religion into a <hi>Lifeleſs Image,</hi> which ſhall be proved to have fallen out amongſt them. And becauſe I intend their benefit principally who reſolve all their Perſwaſion in Religion into the <hi>Word of God,</hi> I ſhall deduce theſe Principles from that Paſſage of it in the <hi>firſt Epiſtle of the Apoſtle</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and <hi>the three firſt Verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Verſe</hi> contains an Exhortation unto, or an Injunction of univerſal Holineſs, by the laying aſide, or caſting out whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto; <hi>wherefore lay aſide all Malice, and all guile, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and envy, and all evil ſpeaking;</hi> the Rule whereof extends unto all other vicious habits of Mind whatever.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Second,</hi> there is a Profeſſion of the <hi>Means</hi> whereby this <hi>End</hi> may be attained; namely, how any one may be ſo ſtrengthened in Grace, as to caſt out all ſuch ſinful Inclinations and Practiſes as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Holineſs required of us, which is the <hi>Divine Word;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared therefore unto <hi>Food,</hi> which is the Means of preſerving Natural Life, and of increaſing its ſtrength. <hi>As new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereon the Apoſtle proceeds to declare the <hi>Condition</hi> whereon our profiting, growing and thriving by the Word, doth depend; and this is an experience of its Power, as it is the Inſtrument of God, whereby he conveys his Grace unto us; <hi>if ſo be that ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. Therein lies the firſt and chief Principle of our enſuing Demonſtration; and it is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the Benefit and Advantage which any men do or may receive by the Word, or the Truths of the Goſpel, depend on an experience of its Power and Efficacy, in communicating the Grace of God unto their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Principle is evident in it ſelf, and not to be queſtioned by any but ſuch as never had the leaſt real ſence of Religion on their own Minds. Beſides, it is evidently contained in the Teſtimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle before laid down.</p>
            <p>Hereunto three other <hi>Principles</hi> of equal Evidence with it ſelf, are ſuppoſed, and virtually contained in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Power and Efficacy in the Word, and the Preaching of it,</hi> Rom. 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>d is quick and powerful,</hi> Heb. 4.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Power that is in the Word of God, conſiſts in its efficacy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Grace of God, unto the Souls of man;</hi> in and by it they <hi>taſte that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42587:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Salvation,</hi> with all things requiſite thereunto; ſuch as the Illumination of our Minds, and the Renovation of our Natures, the Juſtification of our Perſons, the Life of God in holy Worſhip and Obedience, all lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto our eternal enjoyment of him. Theſe are the Ends whereunto the Goſpel is deſigned in the wiſdom of God, whereunto its efficacy is confined.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is an Experience to be obtained of the power and efficacy of the Word.</hi> In that place of the Apoſtle it is expreſſed by <hi>taſting.</hi> But there is ſomething <hi>antecedent</hi> unto their <hi>taſting ſpecially ſo called,</hi> and ſomething <hi>conſequent</hi> unto it, both <hi>inſeparable</hi> from it, and therefore belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Experience</hi> whereof we ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wherefore;</hi> The firſt thing required hereunto is <hi>Light;</hi> that is, a ſpiritual ſupernatural Light, enabling us to diſcern the Wiſdom, Will and Mind of God in the Word, in a ſpiritual manner, without which, we can have no experience of its Power. Hence <hi>the Goſpel is hid unto them that periſh,</hi> though it be outwardly declared unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. This is the only Means which lets into the Mind and Conſcience a ſence of this efficacy. This, in the increaſes of it, the Apoſtle prays for on the behalf of Believers, that they may have this experience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. and declares the Nature of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Taſte</hi> intended follows hereon; wherein conſiſts the Life and Subſtance of the <hi>Experience</hi> pleaded. And this <hi>Taſte is a ſpiritual ſenſe of the Goodneſs, Power and Efficacy of the Word, and the things contained in it, in the conveyance of the Grace of God unto our Souls,</hi> in the Inſtances mentioned, and others of a like nature: for in a <hi>Taſte,</hi> there is a ſweetneſs unto the Palat, and a ſatisfaction unto the Appetite. By the one, in this <hi>Taſte</hi> our Minds are refreſhed; and by the other our Souls are nouriſhed: Of both Believers have an experience. And this is let into the Mind by <hi>Spiritual Light,</hi> without which nothing of it is attainable. <hi>God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, ſhine into your hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of his Glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To compleat the <hi>Experience</hi> intended, there follows hereon a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> in the whole Soul and Converſation unto the Truth of the Word, or the Mind of God in it, wrought in us by its power and efficacy. So the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>If ſo be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him as the Truth is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; that you put off concerning the former Converſation, the old man which is corrupt, according to the deceitful lusts. and be renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, and that you put on the new man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon follows our <hi>laſt Principle,</hi> which is the immediate founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enſuing Diſcourſe, or that which is to be confirmed; and it is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Loſs of an Experience of the Power of Religion, hath been the Cauſe of the loſs of the Truth of Religion; <hi>or it hath been the Cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting its</hi> Subſtance, <hi>and ſetting up</hi> a Shadow or Image <hi>in the room of it.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:42587:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This <hi>Transformation</hi> of all things in Religion, began and proceeded on theſe Grounds. Thoſe who had the Conduct of it, were always poſſeſſed of the <hi>General Notions of Truth,</hi> which they could not forget without a total Renunciation of the Goſpel it ſelf. But having loſt all <hi>Experience</hi> of this power in themſelves, they wreſted them unto things quite of another nature, deſtructive to the Truth, as well as devoid of its Power: Hereon it came to paſs that there was a <hi>dead I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> made and ſet up of Religion in all the parts of it, called by the Name of that which was true and living, but utterly loſt. All Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, I ſay, of the power and efficacy of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and the Truths of it, in communicating the Grace of God unto the Souls of men being loſt, retaining the <hi>general Notion of it,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and framed an <hi>outward Image</hi> or Repreſentation of them, ſuited unto their Ignorance and Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Thus was the truth of Religion once almoſt totally loſt in the world, as we ſhall ſee; neither will it ever be loſt <hi>any other way,</hi> or by any other means. When <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Nations</hi> are poſſeſſed of the Truth and the Profeſſion of it, it is not Laws, nor Fines, nor Impriſonments, nor Gibbets, nor Fires, that ſhall ever diſpoſſeſs them, or deprive them of it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt an <hi>Experience</hi> of the Power of Religion continued in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times,</hi> all the bloody Rage and Cruelty of the world, all the Craft of Satan, and the Subtilty of Seducers, who abounded, did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fail in attempting to <hi>deprive Chriſtians of the Truth,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it. But when this began to decay, and be loſt amongſt them, they were quickly deceived, and drawn off from the <hi>Simplicity of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Reformation of Religion in theſe parts of the world, when the Truth was received in the <hi>Love and Power of it,</hi> and multitudes had experience of the ſpiritual benefit and advantage which they received thereby, in Liberty, Holineſs and Peace; all the Priſons, Tortures, Swords and Fires, that were applied unto its extirpation, did nothing but diffuſe the Profeſſion of it, and root it more firmly in the minds of men. It cannot be loſt but by another way, and other means.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and their <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> have been for an hundred years, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Arts</hi> for the diſpoſſeſſing Nations and Churches of the Truth which they have received, and the introducing the <hi>Romiſh Superſtition.</hi> They have <hi>written Books about it,</hi> and practiſed according to their Principles in every Kingdom and State of <hi>Europe,</hi> who own the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> But the folly of moſt of their pretended <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Devices</hi> unto this end, hath been ridiculous and unſucceſsleſs; and what they have added hereunto of <hi>Force,</hi> hath been divinely defeated.</p>
            <p>There is but <hi>one way, one effectual Engine</hi> to deprive any People of the Profeſſion of the Truth which they have once received; and that is, by leading them into ſuch Prophaneneſs and Ignorance, as whereby they may loſe all <hi>Experience of its Power and Efficacy in communicating the Grace of God unto their Souls,</hi> and therein of all ſenſe of the advantage which

            <p>There is much talk of a <hi>Plot and Conſpiracy</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery</hi> again amongſt us; they may do well to take care thereof, who are concern'd in publick Affairs: but as unto the Event, there is but one <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> that is greatly to be feared in this matter, and that is between <hi>Satan</hi> and the <hi>Luſts</hi> of men; if they can prevail to deprive the Generality of men of an Experience in their own minds of the Power and Efficacy of the Truth, with the ſpiritual Advantage which they may have thereby, they will give them up to be an <hi>eaſie prey</hi> unto the other Deſigners. And there are two Engines that are applied unto this purpoſe; the one is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the other is <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or Senſuality of Life. Whenever either of theſe prevails, the <hi>Experience</hi> intended muſt neceſſarily be loſt and excluded: And the means of their prevailing, are <hi>want of due Inſtruction</hi> by thoſe who are the Leaders of the People, and the <hi>encouragement</hi> of Senſuality, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity and great Examples.</p>
            <p>This is the only <hi>formidable Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the Profeſſion of the Truth in this Nation, without whoſe Aid, all power and force will be fruſtrate in the Iſſue. And as there is a great appearance in Divine Permiſſion of ſuch a <hi>ſtate of things at preſent amongſt us,</hi> ſo if they be manag'd by <hi>Counſel</hi> alſo, and that thoſe ways of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> are countenanced and promoted for this very End, that the power of Truth being loſt, the Profeſſion of it may be given up on eaſie terms, there is nothing but <hi>Sovereign Grace</hi> that can prevent the Deſign. For the <hi>Principle</hi> which we have laid down, is uncontrollable in Reaſon and Experience; namely, That <hi>the loſs of an Experience of the power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, will iſſue one way or other, in the loſs of the Truth of Religion, and the Profeſſion of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence is it that ſo many corrupt Opinions have made ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road on <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the Profeſſion of it? Is it not from hence, that many have loſt an <hi>Experience</hi> of the power and efficacy of the Truth, and ſo have parted with it? Whence is it that <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and Senſuality of Life, with all manner of corrupt Luſts of the Fleſh, have grown up, unto the ſhame of Profeſſion? Is it not from the ſame Cauſe, as the Apoſtle expreſly declares it comes by? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 2, 3, 4, 5. One way or other the loſs of Experience of the power of Truth, will end in the loſs of the profeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>But I proceed unto the Inſtance which I do deſign in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Religion of it at this day, is nothing but a <hi>dead Image of the Goſpel,</hi> erected in the loſs of an experience of its ſpiritual power, overthrowing its Uſe, with all its Ends, being ſuited to the Taſte of men, carnal, ignorant and ſuperſtitious.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall make evident by all ſorts of <hi>Inſtances</hi> in things relating to the Perſon and Offices of Chriſt, the State, Order and Worſhip of the Church, with the Graces and Duties of Obedience required in the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42587:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> Goſpel. And in all, my principal Deſign is to demonſtrate <hi>what is the only way and means of ſecuring our own Souls, any Church or Nation, from being inſnared with, or prevailed againſt by Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a general Notion of Truth, that the <hi>Lord Chriſt in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Grace, is to be propoſed and repreſented unto men as the principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Faith and Love.</hi> He himſelf in his divine Perſon, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inviſible unto us, and as unto his humane Nature abſent from us. <hi>For the Heavens muſt receive him until the time of the reſtitution of all things.</hi> There muſt therefore an <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of him be made unto our Minds, or he cannot be the proper Object of our Faith, Truſt, Love, and Delight. This is done in the Goſpel, and the preaching of it; for therein he is <hi>evidently ſet forth before our eyes as crucified amongſt us, Gal.</hi> 3.1. So alſo are all the other Concerns of his Perſon and Offices therein clearly propoſed unto us; yea, this is the <hi>principal End</hi> of the Goſpel, namely, to make a due Repreſentation of the Perſon, Offices, Grace and Glory of Chriſt, unto the Souls of men, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and <hi>believing, have eternal Life,</hi> John 20.31.</p>
            <p>Upon this Repreſentation made of Chriſt and his Glory in the Goſpel, and the Preaching of it, Believers have an <hi>Experience</hi> of the power and efficacy of the divine Truth contained therein, in the way before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as the Apoſtle declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For we all with open face, beholding as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having a <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> to diſcern and behold the Glory of Chriſt, as repreſented in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, they have experience of its <hi>transfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ming power</hi> and efficacy, changing them into the likeneſs of the <hi>Image</hi> repreſented unto them, that is, of Chriſt himſelf; which is the ſaving effect of Goſpel-power.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> was loſt among men, through th efficacy of their Darkneſs and Unbelief; they were not able to diſcover the Glory of Chriſt, as revealed and propoſed in the Goſpel, ſo as to make him the preſent Object of their Faith and Love. And this <hi>Light</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, they could have no <hi>experience</hi> of the power of Divine Truth concerning him, changing them into his Image. They could make no <hi>affecting diſcovery</hi> of him in the Scripture. All things therein were dark and confuſed, or at leaſt ſeemed an inacceſſible Myſtery, which they could not reduce to practice.</p>
            <p>Hence thoſe who had got the publick conduct of Religion, drove the people from <hi>Reading the Scripture,</hi> as that which was of no uſe, but rather dangerous unto them.</p>
            <p>What ſhall theſe men then betake themſelves unto? ſhall they reject the notion in general, that there ought to be <hi>ſuch a repreſentation made of Chriſt unto the minds of men,</hi> as to inflame their devotion, to excite their Faith, and ſtir up their affection to him? This cannot be done without an open Renunciation of him, and of the Goſpel as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:42587:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Wherefore they will find out another way for it, another means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame end. And this is, by <hi>making Images of him of wood and ſtone. or Gold and Silver, or painting on them.</hi> Hereby they ſuppoſed he would be made <hi>preſent unto his Worſhippers,</hi> That he would be ſo repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as that they ſhould be immediately ſtirred up unto the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Faith and Love. And herein they found ſenſible effects unto their great ſatisfaction: For their minds being dark, carnal and prone to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, as are the minds of all men by nature, they would ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Spiritual Repreſentation of him in the Goſpel,</hi> that had any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on them, or did in any meaſure affect them. In theſe <hi>Images,</hi> by the means of <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi> they found that which did really work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Affections, and as they thought, did excite them unto the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And this was the true Original of all the <hi>Imagery</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as ſomething of the ſame nature in general was of all the Image-worſhip in the World. So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs when they made the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> did it to have a <hi>repreſentation of a Deity</hi> near unto them, in ſuch a viſible manner, as that their Souls might be affected with it; ſo they expreſſed themſelves, <hi>Exod</hi> 32 1.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in this State, under a loſs of <hi>Spiritual Light and Experience,</hi> men of ſuperſtitious minds, found themſelves intangled. They knew it neceſſary that there ſhould be <hi>ſuch a Repreſentation</hi> made of Chriſt as might render him <hi>a preſent Object</hi> of Faith and love, wherewith they might be immediately affected. How this was done in the Goſpel, they could not underſtand, nor obtain any experience of the power and efficacy of it unto this end. Yet the <hi>Principle</hi> it ſelf muſt be retained, as that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there could be no Religion; wherefore to explicate themſelves out of this difficulty, they break through all Gods Commands to the contrary, and betook themſelves to the making <hi>Images of Chriſt,</hi> and their adoration. And from ſmall beginnings, according as Darkneſs and Superſtition increaſed in the minds of men, there was a progreſs in this practiſe, until theſe <hi>Images</hi> took the whole work of repreſenting Chriſt and his Glory, out of the hands, as it were, of the Goſpel, and appropriated it unto themſelves.</p>
            <p>For I do not ſpeak of them now ſo much as they are <hi>Images of Christ,</hi> or Objects of Adoration; as of their being <hi>dead Images of the Goſpel;</hi> that is ſomewhat ſet up in the room of the Goſpel and for the ends of it, as means of teaching and inſtruction. They ſhall do the work which the Goſpel was deſigned of God to do: For as unto this end of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſt, as the preſent object of the Faith and Love of man, with an efficacy to work upon their affections, there is in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a thouſand times more aſcribed unto them, than unto the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The whole matter is ſtated by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, ſay not in thine heart who ſhall aſcend unto heaven (that is to bring Chriſt down from above) or who ſhall deſcend into the deep (that is to bring Chriſt up again from the dead) but what
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42587:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaith it? The word is nigh thee in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> The Enquiry is, how we may be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſt, and righteouſneſs by him; or how we may have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, or have him <hi>preſent with us.</hi> This, ſaith the Apoſtle, is done by the <hi>word of the Goſpel</hi> which is preached, which is nigh unto us in our mouths, and in our hearts; No ſay theſe men, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how it ſhould be ſo; we do not find that it is ſo, that Chriſt is made <hi>nigh unto us, preſent with us</hi> by this word. Wherefore we will <hi>aſcend into Heaven</hi> to bring down Chriſt from above; for we will make <hi>Images of him</hi> in his glorious ſtate in Heaven, and thereby he will be <hi>preſent with us,</hi> or <hi>nigh unto us.</hi> And we will <hi>deſcend into the deep,</hi> to bring up Chriſt again from the dead, and we will do it, by making firſt <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> and then <hi>Images</hi> of his <hi>glorious Reſurrection</hi> bringing him again unto us from the dead. This ſhall be in the place and room of that <hi>word of the Goſpel</hi> which you pretend to be alone uſeful and effectual unto theſe ends.</p>
            <p>This therefore is evident, that the Introduction of this Abomination in principle and practiſe, deſtructive unto the Souls of men, took its Riſe from the loſs of an <hi>Experience</hi> of the Repreſentation of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and the transforming power in the minds of men, which it is accompanied with, in them that believe. <hi>Make us Gods ſay the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites to go before us; for as for this man Moſes</hi> (who repreſented God unto us) <hi>we know not what is become of him.</hi> What would you have men do? would you have them live without all Senſe of the preſence of Chriſt with them, or being nigh unto them? Shall they have no Repreſentation of him? no, no, make us Gods that may go before us; let us have <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> unto this end; for how elſe it may be done, we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>And this is the Reaſon of their obſtinacy in this practiſe againſt all means of conviction: yea they live hereon in a perpetual contradiction unto themſelves: Their <hi>Temples</hi> are full of <hi>Graven Images</hi> like the houſe of <hi>Micah, houſes of God;</hi> and yet in them, are the Scriptures (though in a Tongue unknown to the people) wherein <hi>that practiſe is utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> that a man would think them diſtracted to hear what their <hi>Book ſays,</hi> and to ſee what they do in the ſame place. But nothing will reach unto their conviction, until the vail of <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and Ignorance be taken from their minds; until they have a <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> enabling them to diſcern the Glory of Chriſt as repreſented in the Goſpel, and to let in an Experience of the transforming power and efficacy of that Revelation in their own Souls, they will never part with that means for the ſame end, which they are ſenſible of, to be uſeful unto it; and which is ſuited unto their inclination. Whatever be the iſſue, though it coſt them their Souls, they will not part with what they find, as they ſuppoſe, ſo <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> unto their great end of making Chriſt <hi>nigh unto them;</hi> for that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can ſee nothing of it, and of whoſe power they can have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42587:115"/>
            <p>But the principal Deſign of this Diſcourſe, is to warn others of theſe Abominations, and to direct unto their avoidance: for if they ſhould be outwardly preſſed unto the practice of this Idolatry, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of carnal Affection, of blind Devotion, or Superſtition in them, will quickly be won over unto a Conſpiracy againſt their Convictions. Nothing will then ſecure them but an experience of the efficacy of that Repreſentation which is made of Chriſt in the Goſpel. It is therefore the Wiſdom and Duty of all thoſe who deſire a ſtability in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Truth, continually to endeavour after this <hi>Experience,</hi> and an increaſe in it. He who lives in the exerciſe of Faith and Love in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as revealed in the Goſpel, as evidently crucified, and evidently exalted therein, and finds the fruit of his ſo doing in his own Soul, will be preſerved in the time of Trial. Without this, men will at laſt begin to think that it is better to have a <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> than <hi>none at all;</hi> they will ſuppoſe that <hi>ſomething</hi> is to be found in an <hi>Image,</hi> when they can find <hi>nothing</hi> in the Goſpel.</p>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p n="2">II. It is a prevalent Notion of Truth, That <hi>the Worſhip of God ought to be beautiful and glorious:</hi> The very Light of Nature ſeems to direct unto Conceptions hereof. What is not ſo, may be juſtly rejected, as unbecoming the Divine Majeſty; And therefore the more <hi>holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> any Religion pretends to be, the more <hi>glorious</hi> is the Worſhip preſcribed in it, or ought ſo to be: Yea, the true Worſhip of God is the height and excellency of all Glory in this world; it is inferiour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing, but that which is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which it is the beginning of, the way unto, and the beſt preparation for. Accordingly even that Worſhip is declared to be <hi>glorious,</hi> and that in an eminent manner, above all, the outward Worſhip of the Old Teſtament in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> whoſe <hi>Glory</hi> was great, and as unto external Pomp, inimitable. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle diſputes at large, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This therefore is agreed, that there ought to be <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in divine Worſhip, and that they are moſt eminently in that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and required in the Goſpel. But withal the Apoſtle declares in the ſame place, that this Glory is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and not <hi>Carnal;</hi> ſo did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt foretel that it ſhould be; and that unto that end all <hi>diſtinction</hi> of places, with all outward advantages and Ornaments belonging unto them, ſhould be taken away, <hi>John</hi> 4 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>It belongs therefore unto our preſent Deſign, to give a brief Account of <hi>its Glory,</hi> and wherein it excels all other ways of divine Worſhip that ever were in the world; even that under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which was of divine Inſtitution, wherein all things were ordered for <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> And it may be given in the Inſtances that enſue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The expreſs <hi>Object</hi> of it is God, not as abſolutely conſidered, but as exiſting in <hi>three Perſons,</hi> of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</hi> This is the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42587:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> principal Glory of Chriſtian Religion and its Worſhip. Under the Old Teſtament the Conceptions of the Church about the <hi>Exiſtence of the Divine Nature in diſtinct Perſons,</hi> were very dark and obſcure, for the full Revelation of it was not to be made, but in the <hi>diſtinct actings</hi> of each Perſon in the works of Redemption and Salvation of the Church; that is, in the <hi>Incarnation of the Son,</hi> and <hi>Miſſion</hi> of the Spirit, after he was glorified, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. And in all the ways of <hi>Natural Worſhip,</hi> there was never the leaſt ſhadow of any reſpect hereunto. But this is the foundation of all the Glory of Evangelical Worſhip. The Object of it in the Faith of the Worſhipper, is the Holy Trinity, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an Aſcription of Divine Glory unto each Perſon in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature by the ſame Act of the Mind; where this is not, there is no Glory in Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its Glory conſiſts in that conſtant reſpect which it hath unto each <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> as unto their peculiar work and actings for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; ſo it is deſcribed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through him</hi> (that is, the Son as Mediator) <hi>we have our acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> This is the immediate Glory of Evangelical Worſhip, comprehenſive of all the Graces and Priviledges of the Goſpel. And to ſuppoſe that the Glory of it doth conſiſt in any thing but the <hi>Light, Graces</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> which it doth it ſelf exhibit, is a vain Imagination: It will not borrow Glory from the Invention of men; we ſhall therefore a little conſider it as it is here repreſented by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimate Object</hi> of it, under this conſideration, is God as the <hi>Father; we have an acceſs therein</hi> unto the <hi>Father.</hi> And this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in our worſhip of God as a <hi>Father,</hi> relating unto the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his Love and Grace, by Chriſt Jeſus, as he is God, and our God, his Father, and our Father, is peculiar unto Goſpel-worſhip, and contains a ſignal part of its glory. We do not only worſhip God as a <hi>Father;</hi> ſo the very Heathens had a Notion that he was a <hi>Father</hi> of all things; but we worſhip <hi>him, who is the Father,</hi> and as he is ſo, both in relation to the eternal Generation of the Son, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Grace by him unto us, as our Father; <hi>ſo no man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son, who is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> John 1.18. This Acceſs in our worſhip unto the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father,</hi> as in Heaven, the holy Place above, as on a Throne of Grace, is the glory of the Goſpel. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Son</hi> is here conſidered as <hi>Mediator;</hi> through him <hi>we have this acceſs unto the Father.</hi> This is the Glory that was hidden from former Ages, but brought to light, and diſplay'd by the Goſpel. So ſpeaks our bleſſed Saviour himſelf unto his Diſciples; <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you: Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name, ask, and ye ſhall receive,</hi> Iohn 16.23, 24. To ask God expreſly in the Name of the Son, as Mediator, belongs unto the Glory of the Goſpel-worſhip.</p>

               <p>The chief of them may be reduced to theſe three Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is he who makes both the perſons of the Worſhippers, and their Duties <hi>accepted</hi> of God. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is the Adminiſtrator of all the worſhip of the Church in the holy place above, as its <hi>great High Prieſt</hi> over the Houſe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Preſence</hi> with and among Goſpel-worſhippers in their worſhip, gives it Glory. This he declares and promiſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19, 20. <hi>If two of you ſhall agree on earth as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven; for where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> All Succeſs of the Prayers of the Church dependeth on, and ariſeth from the preſence of Chriſt amongſt them: He is ſo preſent for their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and for their conſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation. This preſence of a <hi>Living Chriſt,</hi> and not a dead <hi>Crucifix,</hi> gives Glory to Divine worſhip. He who ſees not the Glory of this Worſhip, from its relation unto Chriſt, is a ſtranger unto the Goſpel, with all the Light, Graces and Privileges of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is in <hi>one Spirit</hi> that we have <hi>Acceſs</hi> unto God in his Worſhip; and in his Adminiſtration doth the Apoſtle place the <hi>glory</hi> of it in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unto all the glory of the Old Teſtament, as doth our Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo in the place before referred unto; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The whole <hi>Ability</hi> for the obſervance and performance of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of God, is from him alone. His communication of Grace and Gifts unto the Church, is that alone which makes it to give glory to God in his Divine Service: If this ſhould ceaſe, all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Worſhip would ceaſe in the world. To think to obſerve the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel, without the Aid and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of the Goſpel, is a lewd imagination. But where he is, there <hi>is Liberty</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By him the ſanctified Minds of Believers are made <hi>Temples of God,</hi> and ſo the principal Seal of Evangelical worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.8. This <hi>Temple</hi> being of God's own framing, and of his own adorning by his Spirit, is a much more glorious Fabrick than any that the hands of men can erect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By him is the Church led into <hi>internal Communion</hi> and Converſe with God in Chriſt in Light, Love, and Delight, with holy boldneſs; the glory whereof is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>In theſe things, I ſay, doth the <hi>true Glory of Evangelical Worſhip</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and if it doth not, it hath no Glory in compariſon of that which did excel in the Old Legal Worſhip. For the wit of man was never yet able to ſet it off with half the outward Beauty and Glory that was in the Worſhip of the Temple.

               <p>It will be ſaid, that the things whereunto we aſſign the Glory of this Worſhip are <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>inviſible.</hi> Now this is not that which is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after; but that whoſe <hi>Beauty</hi> we may behold, and be affected with. And this may conſiſt in the things which we <hi>decry,</hi> at leaſt in ſome of them: though I muſt ſay, if there be <hi>Glory</hi> in any of them, the more they are multiplied, the better it muſt needs be; but this is that which we plead, Men being not able by the <hi>Light</hi> of Faith, to diſcern the Glory of things ſpiritual and inviſible, do make <hi>Image,</hi> of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, as Gods that may go before them, and theſe they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected withal: but the Worſhip of the Church is ſpiritual, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it is inviſible unto eyes of Fleſh. So both our Saviour and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles do teſtifie in the Celebration of it; <hi>We come unto Mount Sion, and unto the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to the Blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. The Glory of this Aſſembly, though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly above that of <hi>Organs,</hi> and <hi>Pipes,</hi> and <hi>Crucifixes,</hi> and <hi>Veſtments,</hi> yet doth not appear unto the Senſe or Imaginations of men.</p>
               <p>That which I deſign here, is to obviate the <hi>Meritricious Allurements</hi> of the <hi>Roman Worſhip,</hi> and the Pretences of its efficacy to excite Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Veneration by its Beauty and Decency.

To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and preſerve in our hearts an experience of the power and efficacy of that Worſhip of God which is <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> as unto all the real Ends of Divine Worſhip, is that alone which will ſecure us.

                  </gap>. The Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt herein, and our participation of him, are expreſſed in ſuch a manner as to demonſtrate them to be <hi>peculiar;</hi> ſuch as are not to be obtained in any other way, or divine Ordinance whatever; not in Praying, not in Preaching, not in any other exerciſe of Faith on the Word or Promiſes. There is in it an <hi>eating and drinking of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> with a ſpiritual <hi>Incorporation</hi> thence enſuing, which are peculiar unto this Ordinance. But,</p>
               <p>This eſpecial and peculiar communion with Chriſt, and participation of him, is <hi>Spiritual and Myſtical,</hi> by Faith, not carnal or fleſhly. To ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any other participation of Chriſt in this life but by Faith, is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Goſpel. To ſignify the Real communication of himſelf and benefits of his Mediation unto them that believe, whereby they ſhould become the food of their Souls, nouriſhing them unto eternal Life, in the very beginning of his Miniſtry, he himſelf expreſſeth it by <hi>eating of his fleſh and drinking of his blood, John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except you eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood you have no life in you.</hi> But hereon many were offended, as ſuppoſing that he had intended an <hi>oral, carnal eating</hi> of his fleſh and drinking of his blood, and ſo would have taught them to be <hi>Cannibals.</hi> Wherefore to inſtruct his Diſciples aright in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, he gives an Eternal Rule of the interpretation of ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>v.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi> To look for any other communication of Chriſt, or of his fleſh and blood, but what is Spiritual, is to contradict him in the Interpretation which he gives of his own words.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this eſpecial <hi>Communion</hi> with Chriſt, <hi>and Participation of him is by Faith.</hi> If it were not, unbelievers ought all partake of Chriſt aſwell as thoſe that believe, which is a contradiction: For to believe in Chriſt, and to be made partakers of him are one and the ſame. We muſt therefore find this peculiar participating of Chriſt in the <hi>ſpecial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings of Faith</hi> with reſpect unto the eſpecial and peculiar exhibition of Chriſt unto us in this Ordinance. And theſe actings of Faith are diverſe and many; but may be referred unto four Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It acts it ſelf by <hi>Obedience</hi> unto the Authority of Chriſt in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. This is the foundation of all Communion with Chriſt, or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it was in the <hi>ſame night wherein he was betrayed;</hi> when his holy Heart was
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42587:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the higheſt exerciſe of zeal for the glory of God, and compaſſion for the Souls of ſinners, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith hath herein an eſpecial regard unto all theſe things. It doth not only act it ſelf by a ſubjection of Soul and Conſcience unto the Authority of Chriſt in the Inſtitution, but reſpects alſo the exerting of his authority in the Cloſe of his <hi>Prophetical</hi> and entrance of the exerciſe of his <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Office, on the Earth; with all thoſe other circumſtances of it, which recommend it unto the Souls and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Believers.</p>
               <p>This is peculiar unto this Ordinance, and unto this way of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Chriſt. And herein faith in its due exerciſe gives the ſoul an intimate converſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is in this divine Ordinance, a peculiar <hi>Repreſentation of the Love and Grace of Chriſt in his death and Sufferings,</hi> with the way and manner of our Reconciliation unto God thereby. The principal deſign of the Goſpel is to declare unto us the Love and Grace of Chriſt, and our Reconciliation unto God by his Blood. Howbeit herein there is ſuch an eminent <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of them, as cannot be made by words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. It is a <hi>Spiritual Image</hi> of Chriſt propoſed unto us, intimately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our whole Souls. Theſe things, namely, the ineffable Love and Grace of Chriſt, the bitterneſs of his Sufferings and Death in our ſtead, the Sacrifice that he offered by his Blood unto God, with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it in Atonement and Reconciliation, being herein contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one entire Propoſal unto our Souls, Faith is exerciſed thereon in a peculiar manner, and ſo as it is not in any Divine Ordinance or way of the Propoſal of the ſame things unto us.</p>
               <p>All theſe things are indeed diſtinctly, and in parts, ſet before us in the Scripture for our Inſtruction &amp; Edificacion. But as the Light which was firſt made and diffuſed unto the whole Creation, did ſuffice to enlighten it in a general way, yet was far more uſeful, glorious and conſpicuous, when it was reduced and contracted into the Body of the Sun; ſo the Truths concerning Chriſt, as they are diffuſed through the Scripture, are ſufficient for the <hi>Illumination</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of the Church; but when by divine wiſdom and inſtitution they are contracted into this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, their taſte and efficacy is more eminent and communicative unto the eyes of our Underſtandings, that is, our Faith, than as meerly propoſed by parts and parcels in the Word.</p>
               <p>Hereby Faith leads the Soul unto a peculiar Communion with Chriſt, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ch is thereon made partaker of him in an eſpecial manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith herein reſpects the <hi>peculiar way of the communication and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Chriſt unto us, by ſymbols, or ſenſible outward Signs of Bread and Wine.</hi> It finds the divine Wiſdom ond Sovereignty of Chriſt in the choice of them, having no other foundation in Reaſon or the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Repreſentation that is made herein of him, with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Death and Oblation, is ſuited unto Faith only, without any aid of Senſe or Imagination: for although the Symbols are viſible, yet their Relation unto the things ſignified, is not diſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nible unto any Senſe or Reaſon. Had he choſen for this end an <hi>Image</hi> or a <hi>Crucifix,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42587:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> or any ſuch <hi>Actions</hi> as did by a kind of natural and ſenſible Reſemblance, ſhew forth his Paſſion, and what he did and ſuffered, there had been no need of Faith in this matter. And therefore as we ſhall ſee, ſuch things are found out unto this end, by ſuch as have loſt the uſe and exerciſe of Faith herein. Beſides, it is Faith alone that apprehends the <hi>Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that is between the outward Signs and the Things ſignified by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Divine Inſtitution: And hereby the one, that is, the Body and Blood of Chriſt, are really exhibited and communicated unto the Souls of Believers, as the outward Signs are unto their bodily Senſes, the Signs becoming thereby <hi>Sacramentally</hi> unto us, what the things ſignified are in themſelves, and are therefore called by their Names. Herein there is a peculiar exerciſe of Faith, and a peculiar <hi>paricipation</hi> of Chriſt, ſuch as are in no other Ordinance whatever. Yea the Actings of Faith with reſpect unto the <hi>Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> between the Signs and Things ſignified, by vertue of divine Inſtitution and Promiſe, is the principal Uſe and Exerciſe of it herein.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a peculiar Exerciſe of Faith in the <hi>Reception of Chriſt, as his Body and Blood are tendred and exhibited unto us in the outward Signs of them;</hi> For though they do not contain <hi>carnally</hi> the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt in them, nor are turned into them, yet they <hi>really exhibit</hi> Chriſt unto them that believe in the participation of them, Faith is the Grace that makes the Soul to receive Chriſt, and whereby it doth actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. <hi>To as ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y as received him, even to as many that believe in his Name,</hi> John 1.12. And it receives him according as he is propos'd and exhibited unto us in the Declaration and Promiſe of the Goſpel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is propoſed, it receives him by the gracious <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Mind unto this Truth, the <hi>choice of him,</hi> cleaving and truſting unto him with the Will, Heart, and Affection, for all the Ends of his Perſon and Offices, as the Mediator between God and man; and in the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Myſterious Propoſal of him, his Body and Blood, that is in the efficacy of his Death and Sacrifice, in this Ordinance of worſhip, Faith acts the whole Soul in the <hi>Reception of him</hi> unto all the eſpecial Ends for which he is exhibited unto us, in this way and manner. What theſe Ends are which give force and efficacy unto the actings of Faith herein, this is not a proper place to declare.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned theſe things, becauſe it is the great Plea of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> at this day in behalf of their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, That if we reject their oral or carnal manducation of the Fleſh of Chriſt, and drinking of his Blood, there cannot be aſſigned a way of the participation of Chriſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him in this Sacrament, diſtinct from that which is done in the Preaching of the Word:</hi> But hereby, as we ſhall ſee, they only declare their ignorance of this heavenly Myſtery.</p>
               <p>But of this bleſſed intimate Communion with Chriſt, &amp; participation of him in the Divine Inſtitution of worſhip, Believers have <hi>Experience</hi> unto their ſatisfaction and ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>able Joy. They find him to be the ſpiritual food of their <hi>Souls,</hi> by which they are nouriſhed unto eternal Life, by a ſpiritual incorporation with him. They diſcern the Truth of this
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42587:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> Myſtery, and have experience of its Power. Howbeit men growing carnal, and being deſtitute of <hi>Spiritual Light,</hi> with the wiſdom of Faith, utterly loſt <hi>all Experience</hi> of any Communion with Chriſt, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of him in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> on the Principles of Goſpel-Truth, they could find nothing in it, no <hi>Power,</hi> no <hi>Efficacy,</hi> nothing that ſhould anſwer the great and glorious things ſpoken of it, nor was it poſſible they ſhould. For indeed there is nothing in it, but unto Faith; as the Light of the Sun is nothing to them that have no eyes: a Dog and a Staff are of more uſe to a blind man, than the Sun, nor is the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious Muſick any thing to them that are deaf; yet notwithſtanding this loſs of ſpiritual Experience, they retained the <hi>Notion</hi> of Truth, that there muſt be a <hi>peculiar participation of Chriſt</hi> in this Sacrament, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from all other ways and means of the ſame Grace.</p>
               <p>Here the Wits of men were hard put to it to find out an <hi>Image</hi> of this ſpiritual Communion, whereof in their minds they could have no Experience; yet they faſhioned one by <hi>degrees,</hi> and after they had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Myſtery in words and expreſſions (whereof they knew nothing in its power) to anſwer unto what was to be ſet up in the room of it, until they brought forth the horrid <hi>Monſter of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs;</hi> for hereby they provided that all thoſe things which are ſpiritual in this Communion, ſhould be turned into, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in things carnal: Bread ſhall be the Body of Chriſt carnally, the Mouth ſhall be Faith, the Teeth ſhall be the Exerciſe, the Belly ſhall be the Heart, and the Prieſt ſhall offer Chriſt unto God, A <hi>Viler Image</hi> was never invented; and there is nothing of Faith required herein, it is all but a fortifying of Imagination againſt all Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Becauſe there is a ſingular Myſtery in the <hi>Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that is between the external Signs and the things ſignified, whence the one is called by the Name of the other, as the <hi>Bread is called the Body of Chriſt,</hi> which Faith diſcerns in the Exhibition and Receiving of it, they have invented for a Repreſentation hereof, ſuch a prodigious <hi>Imagination of the real Converſion</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as overthrows all Faith, Reaſon, and Sence alſo.</p>
               <p>And in the room of that <hi>Holy Reverence</hi> of Chriſt himſelf in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Ordinance, in the <hi>Myſtical Exhibition</hi> of himſelf unto the Souls of Believers, in the demonſtration of his Love, Grace, and Sufferings for them, they have ſet up a wretched <hi>Image</hi> of an <hi>Idolatrous Adoration and Worſhip of the Hoſt,</hi> as they call it, to the Ruine of the Souls of men.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by <hi>once offering perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> appointing this Ordinance for the Remembrance of it, having loſt that ſpiritual Light whereby they might diſcern the efficacy of <hi>that one Offering</hi> ſo long ſince accompliſhed, in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by this Ordinance unto the actual perfecting of the Church; they have erected a <hi>new Image</hi> of it, in a pretended daily <hi>Repetition of the ſame Sacrifice,</hi> wherein they profeſs to offer Chriſt again for the ſins
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42587:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the living and the dead, unto the overthrow of the principal founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>All theſe Abominations aroſe from the loſs of an <hi>Experience</hi> of that ſpiritual Communion with Chriſt, and the participation of him by Faith, which there is in this Ordinance by divine Inſtitution. This caſt the thoughts of men on Invention of theſe <hi>Images,</hi> to ſuit the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion of Truth unto the Superſtition of their carnal minds.

               <p>This <hi>Image,</hi> like that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> was once ſet up in this Nation, with a Law, that <hi>whoever would not bow down to it and worſhip it,</hi> ſhould be caſt into the fiery Furnace. God grant it to be ſo no more, But if it ſhould, there is no preſervation againſt the Influence of Force and Fires, but a real experience of an <hi>efficacious Communication of Chriſt unto our Souls</hi> in this holy Ordinance, adminiſtred according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>This therefore is that we ought with all diligence to endeavour; and this not only as the only way and means of our edification in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by an exerciſe in Grace, the ſtrengthning of our Faith, and preſent Conſolation, but as the effectual means of our preſervation in the profeſſion of the Truth, and our deliverance from the Snares of our Adverſaries. For whereas it is undeniable, that this peculiar Inſtitution diſtinct from all other, doth intend and deſign a diſtinct communication and exhibition of Chriſt; if it be preſſed on us, that theſe muſt be done by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Oral Manducation</hi> thereon, and can be no otherwiſe; nothing but an <hi>Experience</hi> of the power and efficacy of the Myſtical Communion with Chriſt in this Ordinance, before deſcribed, will preſerve us from being enſnared by their Pretences. There is not therefore on all accounts of Grace and Truth any one thing of more concernment unto Believers, than the due exerciſe of Spiritual Light and Faith, unto a ſatisfactory experience of a peculiar participation of Chriſt in this Holy Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The ſame is fallen out amongſt them with reference unto the <hi>Church,</hi> and all the principal Concerns of it; having loſt or renounced the things which belong unto its primitive Conſtitution, they have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>deformed Image</hi> in their ſtead, as I ſhall manifeſt in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p n="4">IV. It is an unqueſtionable Principle of Truth, that the Church of Chriſt is in it ſelf <hi>a Body,</hi> ſuch a Body as hath <hi>an Head,</hi> whereon it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and without which it would immediately be diſſolved; a Body without an Head, is but a Carkaſs, or part of a Carkaſs; and this <hi>Head</hi> muſt be always preſent with it. An Head diſtant from the Body, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it, not united unto it by ſuch ways and means as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto their Nature, is of no uſe. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 15, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>But there is a double Notion of an <hi>Head,</hi> as there is of a Body alſo; For they both of them are either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Political.</hi> There is a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body</hi> and there is a <hi>Political Body;</hi> and in each ſence it muſt have an Head of the ſame kind. A <hi>Natural Body</hi> muſt have an Head of <hi>Vital In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> and a <hi>Political Body</hi> muſt have an Head of Rule and Government. The Church is called a <hi>Body,</hi> compared to it, is a Body in both Sences, or in both parts of the compariſon, and in both muſt have an Head. As it is a <hi>Spiritually living Body,</hi> compared to the <hi>Natural,</hi> it muſt have an Head of <hi>Vital Influence,</hi> without which it cannot ſubſiſt; and as it is an <hi>Orderly Society</hi> for the common Ends of its Inſtitution, compared unto a <hi>Political Body,</hi> it muſt have an Head of <hi>Rule and Government,</hi> without which neither its Being, nor its Uſe can be preſerved.</p>
               <p>But theſe are only <hi>diſtinct Conſiderations</hi> of the Church, which is every way <hi>one</hi> and the ſame. It is not <hi>two Bodies,</hi> for then it muſt have two Heads, but it is <hi>one Body</hi> under two diſtinct Conſiderations, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide not its Eſſence, but declare its different Reſpects unto its Head.</p>
               <p>And in General all who are called Chriſtians, are thus far agreed; nothing is of the Church, nothing belongs unto it, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on, which is not <hi>united</hi> to the Head. That <hi>which holds the Head,</hi> is the true Church, that which doth not ſo, is no Church at all.</p>
               <p>Herein we agree with our Adverſaries, namely, that all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Church, all the Right and Title of men thereunto, depend wholly on their <hi>due Relation to the Head of it,</hi> according to the diſtinct Conſiderations of it, be <hi>that Head</hi> who, or what it will, that which is not united unto the Head, which depends not on it, which is ſeparated from it, belongs not to the Church.</p>
               <p>This Head of the Church is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus alone;</hi> for the Church is but <hi>one,</hi> although on various conſiderations it be likened unto <hi>two ſorts of Bodies.</hi> The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is conſidered either as believing, or as profeſſing; but the Believing Church is not <hi>one,</hi> and the profeſſing <hi>another.</hi> If you ſuppoſe <hi>another Catholick Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this one, whoſo will may be the Head of it, we are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; but unto this Church <hi>Chriſt is the only Head.</hi> He only anſwers all the Properties and Ends of ſuch an Head to the Church: This the Scripture doth ſo poſitively and frequently affirm, without the leaſt intimation either directly or by conſequence of any other Head, that it is wonderful how the imagination of it ſhould befall the Minds of any, who thought it not meet at the ſame time to caſt away their Bibles.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42587:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But whereas an <hi>Head</hi> is to be preſent with the Body, or it cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, the Enquiry is, how the <hi>Lord Chriſt is ſo preſent with his Church?</hi> And the Scripture hath left no pretence for any heſitation herein; for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſo by his <hi>Spirit and his Word,</hi> by which he communicateth all the Powers and <hi>Vertues of an Head</hi> unto it continually. His Promiſes of this way and manner of his <hi>Preſence</hi> unto the Church, are multiplied, and thereon doth the Being, Life, Uſe and Continuance of the Church depend; where Chriſt is not <hi>preſent by his Spirit and Word,</hi> there is no Church; and thoſe who pretend ſo to be, are the <hi>Synagogues of Satan,</hi> and they are inſeparable and conjunct in their operation, as he is the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d of influence</hi> unto the Church, as alſo, as he is an Head of Rule; for in the former ſenſe the Spirit worketh by the <hi>Word,</hi> and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Word is made effectual by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But the Senſe and Apprehenſion hereof, was for a long time loſt in the world, amongſt them that called themſelves the <hi>Church.</hi> An <hi>Head</hi> they did acknowledge the Church muſt always have, without which it cannot ſubſiſt; and they would confeſs that in ſome ſenſe he was <hi>an Head of influence</hi> unto it; they know not how to have an <hi>Image</hi> thereof; though by many other pernicious Doctrines, they overthrew the Efficacy and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it. But how he ſhould be the only <hi>Head of Rule</hi> unto the Church they could not underſtand; they ſaw not how he could act the Wiſdom and Authority of ſuch an Head, and without which the Church muſt be headleſs. They ſaid, he was <hi>abſent</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> they muſt have one that they could <hi>ſee,</hi> and have acceſs unto; he is in Heaven, and they know not how to make Addreſs to him, as occaſion did require; all things would go to <hi>diſorder,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuch an Headſhip. The Church is <hi>viſible,</hi> and it muſt, they thought, have a <hi>viſible</hi> Head. It was meet alſo that this Head ſhould have ſome ſuch Grandeur and Pomp in the World as became the Head of ſo Great and Glorious a Society as the Church is. How to apply theſe things unto Chriſt and his Preſence with the Church, by his Word and Spirit, they knew not.</p>
               <p>Shall they then forgo the <hi>Principle,</hi> That the Church is to have ſuch an Head and Supream Ruler? That muſt not be done, but be ſacredly retained; not only becauſe to deny it in general, is to renounce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; but becauſe they had found out a way to turn it unto their own advantage; they would therefore make <hi>an Image of Chriſt,</hi> as this Head of the Church, to poſſeſs the Place, and act all the Powers of ſuch an Head; for the Church, they ſay is viſible, and muſt have a viſible Head, as though the Catholick Church, as ſuch, were any other way viſible, but as the Head of it is, that is, by Faith. That there muſt be an Head and Center of Union, wherein all the Members of the Church may agree and be united, notwithſtanding all their diſtinct Capacities and Circumſtances, and how this ſhould be Chriſt himſelf, they know not; that without a <hi>Supream Head preſent</hi> in the Church, to compoſe all Differences, and determine all Controverſies, even thoſe concerning himſelf, which they vainly pretend unto, they expreſly affirm, that there was never a Society ſo fooliſhly ordered as that of the Church. And
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42587:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> hereon they conclude the Inſufficiency of Chriſt to be this <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le Head</hi> of the Church, another they muſt have for theſe Ends.</p>
               <p>And this was their <hi>Pope,</hi> ſuch an Image as is one of the worſt of Idols, that ever were in the world. Unto him they give all the Titles of Chriſt, which relate unto the Church, and aſcribe all the Powers of Chriſt in and over it, as unto its Rule, to him alſo. But here they fell into a Miſtake; for when they thought to give him the <hi>Power of Chriſt,</hi> they gave him the <hi>Power of the Dragon,</hi> to uſe againſt Chriſt, and thoſe that are his. And when they thought to make an <hi>Image of Chriſt,</hi> they made an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Beaſt,</hi> ſet up by the Dragon, which had <hi>two Horns like a Lamb,</hi> but ſpake as a Dragon, whoſe Character, and Employ is at large deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>This is the Sum of what I ſhall offer on this Head; Thoſe who called themſelves the Church, had loſt all <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> enabling them to diſcern the Beauty and Glory of the Rule of Chriſt over the Church as its Head; and hereon their Minds became deſtitute of all <hi>Experience</hi> of the power and efficacy of his Spirit and Word, continually to order the Affairs thereof, in the ways, and through the uſe of Means by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appointed; they knew not how to acquieſce in theſe things, nor how the Church could be maintained by them: Wherefore in this caſe, <hi>they helped every one his Neighbour, and every one ſaid to his Brother, be of good comfort; ſo the Carpenter encouraged the Goldſmith, and he that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Neither will this <hi>Idol</hi> be ever caſt out of the Church, until the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Chriſtians become ſpiritually ſenſible of the Authority of Chriſt, exerting it ſelf in the Rule of the Church, by his Spirit and his Word, unto all the Ends of Unity, Order, Peace, and Edification; until that be done, a <hi>Pope</hi> or ſomthing like him, will be thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto theſe Ends.</p>
               <p>But never was there a more horrid <hi>deformed Image</hi> made of ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious an Head: All the Craft of Satan, all the Wits of men cannot invent any thing more unlike Chriſt, as the Head of the Church, than this <hi>Pope</hi> is. A worſe Figure and Repreſentation of him cannot poſſibly be made.</p>
               <p>This is he, of whom, nothing not great, nothing common, nothing not exceeding the ordinary ſtate of Mankind, on the one hand or the other, is thought or ſpoken. Some ſay, he is the <hi>Head and Husband of the Church,</hi> the <hi>Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> over the whole World, <hi>God's Vicegerent</hi> a <hi>Vice-God, Peter's Succeſſor,</hi> the <hi>Head and Center of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> unto the whole Catholick Church, endued with a plenitude of Power, with other Aſcriptions of the ſame nature innumerable; whereon it is neceſſary unto every Soul under pain of Damnation, to be ſubject unto him.</p>
               <p>Others aver that he is <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi>

               <p>Again, it is a Notion of Truth, That <hi>the Church of Chriſt is beautiful and glorious.</hi> There are many Propheſies and Predictions concerning it, that ſo it ſhould be; and there are ſundry deſcriptions given of it as ſuch. Its Relation unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with his Love unto it, and valuation of it, do require that it ſhould be ſo glorious; yea his great Deſign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, was to make it ſo to be, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. This therefore all do agree in who profeſs <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> but <hi>what that Glory is,</hi> and wherein it doth conſiſt, whence it is, and is ſaid to be <hi>glorious,</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon.</p>
               <p>The Scripture indeed plainly declares this Glory to be <hi>Spiritual and internal,</hi> that it conſiſts in its Union unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his preſence with it, the communication of his quickning Spirit unto it, the cloathing of it with his Righteouſneſs, in its Sanctification and Purification from the defilement of Sin, with its fruitfulneſs in Obedience unto the praiſe of God.

                     </gap>mmandments of Chriſt,</hi> and we have the Subſtance of this Glory.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Glory</hi> Believers do diſcern, ſo as to be ſatisfied with its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. They know that all the Glories of the World are no way to be compared to it; for it conſiſts in and ariſes from ſuch things as they do value and prefer infinitely above all that this world can afford. They are a reflexion of the Glory of God, or of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf upon the <hi>Church,</hi> yea a <hi>Communication</hi> of it thereunto. This they value in the whole, and in every Member of it; neither the Nature, Uſe, nor End of the <hi>Church</hi> will admit that its Glory ſhould conſiſt in things of any other Nature.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42587:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But the Generality of mankind had loſt that <hi>Spiritual Light,</hi> wherein alone this Glory might be diſcerned. They could ſee no Form or Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> as only adorned with his Graces. To talk of a glorious State of men, whilſt they are poor and deſtitute, it may be cloathed with rags, and haled unto Priſons or Stakes, as hath been the Lot of the Church in moſt Ages, was in their Judgment a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and fooliſh. Wherefore ſeeing it is certain, that the Church of Chriſt, is <hi>very Glorious</hi> and illuſtrious, in the ſight of God, holy Angels, and Good men, a way muſt be found out to make it ſo, and ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the World. Wherefore they agreed on a lying <hi>Image</hi> of this Glory, namely, the <hi>Dignity, Promotion, Wealth, Dominion, Power</hi> and <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> of them that had got the Rule of the Church. And although it be evident unto all, that theſe things belong unto the <hi>Glories of this World,</hi> which the Glory of the Church is not only diſtinguiſhed from, but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, yet it muſt be looked on as that wherein it is glorious; and it is ſo, though it have not one ſaving Grace in it, as they expreſly affirm. When theſe things are attained, then are all the Predictions of its <hi>Glory</hi> accompliſhed, and the Deſcription of it anſwered.</p>
               <p>This <hi>corrupt Image</hi> of the <hi>true Spiritual Glory</hi> of the Church, ariſing from an Ignorance of it, and want of a real experience of the worth, and excellency of things internal, Spiritual and Heavenly, hath been attended with pernicious conſequents in the World. Many have been infatuated by it, and inamoured of it, unto their own perdition. For as a Teacher of Lies; it is ſuited only to divert the minds of men from a comprehenſion and valuation of that <hi>real Glory,</hi> wherein if they have not an Intereſt they muſt periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>Look into Forreign parts, as <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where theſe men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Church is in its <hi>greateſt Glory,</hi> what is it, but the wealth and pomp and power of men, for the moſt part openly ambitious, ſenſual and worldly? Is this the Glory of the Church of Chriſt? do theſe things belong unto his Kingdom. But by the ſetting up of this Image, by the Advancement of this notion, all the true Glory of the Church hath been loſt and deſpiſed. Yet theſe things being ſuited unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the carnal minds of men, and ſatisfactory unto all their luſts; having got this paint and gilding on them, that they render the Church of Chriſt <hi>Glorious,</hi> have been the means of filling this World with <hi>Darkneſs, Blood</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> For this is that Glory of the Church, which is contended for with Rage and Violence. And not a few, do yet dote on theſe <hi>Images,</hi> who are not ſharers in the advantage it brings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its principal worſhippers; whoſe infatuation is to be bewailed.</p>
               <p>The means of our preſervation from the Adoration of theſe Images alſo is obvious, from the principles we proceed upon. It will not be done; without Light to diſcern the <hi>Glory of things Spiritual and inviſible;</hi> wherein alone the Church is glorious. And in the Light of Faith they appear to be what indeed they are in themſelves, of the ſame nature with the Glory that is above. The preſent Glory of the Church, I ſay,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42587:123" rendition="simple:additions"/> is its imitation unto the Glory of heaven, and in general of the ſame nature with it. Here it is in its dawnings and entrances, there is its ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection. To look for any thing that ſhould be cognate, or of near <hi>Alliance</hi> unto the Glory of Heaven, or any near reſemblance of it, in the outward Glories of this World, is a fond Imagination. And when the mind is enabled to diſcern the true beauty and glory of ſpiritual things, with their Alliance unto that which is above, it will be ſecured from ſeeking after the Glory of the <hi>Church</hi> in things of this World, or putting any value on them unto that end.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Self-Denyal</hi> alſo which is indiſpenſably preſcribed in the Goſpel unto all the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is requiſite hereunto; For the power and practiſe of it, is utterly inconſiſtent with an Apprehenſion, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Power, Riches and Domination, do contribute any thing unto the <hi>Churches</hi> Glory. The mind being hereby crucifyed unto a value and eſtimation of theſe things, it can never apprehend them as any part of that <hi>Raiment of the Church</hi> wherein it is glorious. But where the minds of men through their native Darkneſs, are diſenabled to diſcern the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Spiritual things, and through their carnal, unmortified affection, do cleave unto and have the higheſt eſteem of worldly <hi>Grandeur,</hi> it is no wonder, if they ſuppoſe the <hi>beauty and glory</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to conſiſt in them.</p>

The ends of this Diſcipline, are the <hi>order, peace, purity, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Church, with a Repreſentation of the Love, Care and Watchfulneſs of Chriſt over it, and a Teſtimony unto his future Judgment.</hi> An Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other ends of it, hath been its ruine.</p>
               <p>And thus far all who profeſs themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are agreed, at leaſt in words. None dare deny any of theſe principles, no not to ſecure their abuſe of them, which is the Intereſt of many.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

So the Apoſtle expreſly deſcribes it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>For the Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations and every high thing, that exalteth it ſelf againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, bringing into captivity every thought unto the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are the Ends, as of preaching of the Goſpel, ſo of the Diſcipline of the <hi>Church;</hi> and theſe are the wayes and means of its efficacy: it is <hi>ſpiritually mighty to God,</hi> unto all theſe Ends, and others it hath none. But we ſhall immediately ſee the total Reverſe of this Order, in an <hi>Image</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the room of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of the Power and Efficacy of this <hi>Spiritual Diſcipline</hi> unto its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, the <hi>primitive Chriſtians,</hi> at leaſt, had experience. For 300 years, the <hi>Church</hi> had no other way or means for the preſervation of its Order, Peace, Purity and Holineſs, but the ſpiritual efficacy of this Diſcipline, on the Souls and Conſciences of profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Neither did it fail therein, nor were the <hi>Churches</hi> any longer preſerved in peace and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than whilſt they had this Diſcipline alone for their preſervation, without the leaſt contribution of aſſiſtance from ſecular power, or any thing that ſhould operate on the outward concerns of mankind. And there can be no other reaſon given, why it ſhould not be of the ſame uſe and efficacy ſtill unto all <hi>Churches,</hi> but only the loſs of all thoſe <hi>internal Graces,</hi> which are neceſſary to make any Goſpel Inſtitution effectual; wherefore,</p>
               <p>All Senſe and <hi>Experience</hi> hereof, of the <hi>Spiritual Power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of this <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was utterly loſt, amongſt the moſt of them that are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Neither thoſe who had aſſumed a pretence of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, nor thoſe towards whom it was adminiſtred, could find any thing in it, that did <hi>affect the Conſciences of men,</hi> with reſpect unto its proper ends. They found it a thing altogether uſeleſs in the <hi>Church,</hi> wherein none of any ſort would be concerned.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:42587:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>What ſhall they now do? what courſe ſhall they take? Shall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all thoſe Principles of Truth concerning it, which we have laid down, and exclude it both name and thing out of the <hi>Church?</hi> This probably would have been the end of it, had they not found out a way to wreſt the <hi>pretence of it</hi> unto their unſpeakable advantage; wherefore they contrived and made an <hi>horrid Image</hi> of the holy, ſpiritual Rule and Diſcipline of the Goſpel: An <hi>Image</hi> it was, conſiſting in <hi>outward Force and Tyranny</hi> over the perſons, liberties and lives of men; exerciſed with weapons, <hi>mighty through the Devil</hi> to caſt men into priſon, and to deſtroy them. Hereby that which was appointed for the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> being loſt, an Engine was framed under its name and pretence unto its ruine and deſtruction; and ſo it continues unto this day.</p>
               <p>It had never entred into the hearts of men, to ſet up a Diſcipline in the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> by Law, Courts, Fines, Mulcts, Impriſonments and Burnings, but that they had utterly loſt in themſelves, and ſuffered to be loſt in others concerned, all experience of the Power and Efficacy of the Diſcipline of Chriſt, towards the Souls and Conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>But herein they laid it aſide, as an uſeleſs tool, that might do ſome Service in the hands of the Apoſtles and the primitive <hi>Churches,</hi> whilſt there was Spiritual Life and Senſe left amongſt <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but as unto them and what they aimed at, it was of no uſe at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deformity</hi> of this <hi>Image</hi> in the ſeveral parts of it, its univerſal <hi>diſſimilitude</hi> unto that whoſe name it bears, and which it pretends to be, the ſeveral degrees whereby it was forged, framed and erected, with the occaſions and advantages taken, for its exaltation, would take up much time to declare: For it was ſubtilly interwoven with other abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, in the whole <hi>myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> until it became the very Life or animating Principle of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For however men may ſet light by the Rule and Diſcipline of Chriſt in his <hi>Church,</hi> and its <hi>Spiritual Power or Efficacy</hi> towards the Souls and Conſciences of men, the Rejection of it, and the ſetting up of an <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Image</hi> of worldly power, domination and force, in the room of it, and under its name, is that which began, carried on, and yet maintains the fatal Apoſtacy in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance only in one particular; on the change of this Rule of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and together with it, the ſetting up of <hi>Mauzzins,</hi> or an <hi>Image,</hi> or God of <hi>Forces</hi> in the ſtead of it; they were compelled to change all the ends of that <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and to make an <hi>Image</hi> of them alſo. For this new Inſtrument of <hi>outward Force,</hi> was of no uſe with reſpect unto them: For they are as was declared, the <hi>Spiritual Peace, Purity, Love</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Outward Force is no way meet to attain any of theſe ends. Wherefore they muſt make an <hi>Image</hi> of theſe alſo, or ſubſtitute ſome dead Form in their room; and this was an univerſal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> according unto all the Rules, Orders and Canons which they ſhould invent. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> herein and <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> is all the end which they will allow unto their <hi>Church Diſcipline;</hi> And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42587:124" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Penalties, is fit to attain this end.

               <p>This is that <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> in whoſe execution, the blood of an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> hath been ſhed; that wherein all the <hi>vital Spirits</hi> of the Papacy do act themſelves, and whereby it doth ſubſiſt; and although it be the <hi>Image of Jealouſie</hi> or the <hi>Image of the firſt Beaſt,</hi> ſet up by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> yet it cannot be denyed, but that it is very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated, unto the preſent State of the Generality of them, that are called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> amongſt them.

               <p>Unto the foregoing <hi>particular</hi> Inſtances, with reſpect unto the Church, I ſhall yet add one more <hi>general,</hi> which is indeed comprehenſive of them all: or the root from whence they ſpring; a root-bearing Gall and Wormwood. And this is concerning the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What belongs unto this <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> what is comprized in its Communion? The Apoſtle declares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. It is the <hi>Recapitulation of all things in Heaven and Earth in Chriſt Jeſus. Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>His Body, his Spouſe, or Bride, the Lambs Wife, the glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherein God doth dwell by his Spirit.</hi> An holy myſtical Society, purchaſed and purified by the blood of Chriſt, and united unto him, by his ſpirit, or the Inhabitation of the ſame ſpirit in him, and thoſe whereof it doth conſiſt. Hence they with him, as the body with its head, are myſtically called Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 12.12. And there are two parts of it, the one whereof is already <hi>perfected</hi> in Heaven, as unto their ſpirits, and the other yet continued in the way of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this world. Both theſe conſtitute <hi>one family in Heaven and Earth. Epheſ.</hi> 3.15. In Conjunction with the holy Angels, one Myſtical-Body, one Catholick Church. And although there is a great difference in their preſent ſtate and condition, between theſe two branches of the <hi>ſame Family,</hi> yet are they both equally purchaſed by Chriſt, and united unto him as their Head, having both of them effectually, the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the life of God in them. Of a <hi>third part of this Church,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven nor in Earth, in a temporary State participant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42587:125" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Heaven, and ſomewhat of Hell, called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knoweth nothing at all, neither is it conſiſtent with the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, or the promiſes of God unto them that do believe, as we ſhall ſee immediately.</p>
               <p>This Church even as unto that part of it which is in this world, as it is adorned with all the graces of the Holy Spirit, is the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious effect, next unto the forming and production of its Head in the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> which Divine Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Grace will extend themſelves unto, here below: But theſe things, the glory of this State is viſible only unto the <hi>eye of Faith;</hi> yea it is perfectly ſeen and known only to Chriſt himſelf. We ſee it obſcurely in the light of Faith and Revelation, and are ſenſible of it, according unto our participating of the graces and privileges wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>But that ſpiritual light which is neceſſary to the diſcerning of this Glory, was loſt among thoſe of whom we treat. They could ſee no reality nor beauty in theſe things, nor any thing that ſhould be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto them. For upon their principle, of the <hi>utter uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of mens ſpiritual eſtate and condition in this world, it is evident that they could have no ſatisfactory perſwaſion of any concernment in it.</p>
               <p>But they had poſſeſſed themſelves of the notion of a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which with myſterious Artifices they have turned unto their own incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſecular Advantage. This is that whereof they boaſt, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating it unto themſelves, and making it a pretence of <hi>deſtroying others,</hi> what lies in them both temporally and eternally. Unto this end they have formed the moſt <hi>deformed and deteſtable Image of it,</hi> that ever the world beheld. For the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> which they <hi>own,</hi> and which they boaſt that they are inſtead of that of Chriſt, is a company or ſociety of men, unto whom in order unto the conſtitution of that whole ſociety, there is <hi>no one real Chriſtian grace required, nor ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion unto Chriſt the Head,</hi> but only an outſide profeſſion of theſe things, as they expreſly contend. A Society united unto the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as its head by a ſubjection unto him, and his rule according to the Laws and Canons whereby he will grant them. This is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon and cauſe conſtituting that <hi>Catholick Church</hi> which they are, which is <hi>compacted in it ſelf by horrid Bonds and Ligaments,</hi> for the ends of Ambition, worldly Domination and Avarice. A <hi>Catholick Church</hi> openly <hi>wicked</hi> in the generality of its rulers, and them that are ruled; and in its State <hi>cruel</hi> oppreſſive, and died with the blood of Saints, and Martyrs innumerable.</p>
               <p>This I ſay is that Image of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> the ſpouſe of Chriſt which they have ſet up. And it hath been as the Image of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi> that hath devoured and conſumed the Children of the Church, whoſe cryes, when their cruel ſtep-mother pittied them not, and when their pretended Ghoſtly Fathers caſt them into the flames, came up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>ears of the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> and their blood ſtill cries for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on this idolatrous generation.</p>

               <p>Yet is this pretence of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> preſſed in the minds of many, with ſo many <hi>Sophiſtical</hi> Artifices, through the ſlight <hi>of men and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lye in wait to deceive;</hi> propoſed with the allurements of ſo many ſecular advantages, and impoſed oftimes on Chriſtians with ſo much force and cruelty, that nothing can ſecure us from the Admiſſion of it, unto the utter overthrow of Religion, but the means before inſiſted on. A ſpiritual light is neceſſary hereunto, to diſcern the internal ſpiritual beauty and glory of the true <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt: Where this is in its power, all the paintings and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their deformed Image will fall off from it, and its abominable filth will be made to appear. And this will be accompanied with an effectual experience of the glory and excellency of that grace in the ſouls of thoſe that believe, derived from Chriſt the ſole head of this Church, whereby <hi>they are changed from Glory to Glory, as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> The Power, Life, and ſweetneſs hereof, will give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto their ſouls, to the contempt of the pretended order, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the <hi>Pope</hi> as an head. By theſe means the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is the body of Chriſt, <hi>the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all, growing up unto him in all things who is the head, deſpiſeth this Image,</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi> will fall to the ground when this ark is brought in, yea though it be in his own Temple.</p>

               <p>In the farther opening of this <hi>Chamber of Imagery,</hi> we ſhall yet if it be poſſible, ſee <hi>greater Abominations.</hi> At leaſt that which doth next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, is ſcarce inferiour unto any of them that went before.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>principle</hi> in Chriſtian Religion, an acknowledged <hi>verity</hi> that it is the duty of the <hi>Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially as united in Churches, <hi>to propagate the faith of the Goſpel,</hi> and to make the doctrine of it known unto all, as they have opportunity: yea, this is one principal end of the conſtitution of Churches and officers in them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>This our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave in ſpecial charge unto his Apoſtles at the beginning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. Hereby they were obliged unto the work of propagating the faith of the Goſpel, and the knowledge of him therein in all places, and were juſtified in their ſo doing. And this they did with that efficacy and ſucceſs, that in a ſhort time like the <hi>light of the Sun, their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world, Rom.</hi> 10.18. And the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was ſaid to be <hi>preached unto every Creature which is under Heaven, Col.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p>The way therefore, whereby they propagated the faith, was by <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent laborious preaching of the Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi> unto all perſons in all places, with patience and magnanimity in undergoing all ſorts of ſufferings on the account of it, and a declaration of its power in all thoſe vertues and graces, which are uſeful and exemplary unto mankind.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:42587:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>It is true, their Office, and the diſcharge of it, is long ſince Leaſed; Howbeit it cannot be denyed but that the <hi>Work</hi> it ſelf is incumbent in a way of duty on all Churches, yea on all Believers, as they have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Calls unto it, and Opportunities for it. For it is the principal way whereby they may glorifie God, and benefit men in their chiefeſt Good, which without doubt they are obliged unto. This notion of Truth is retained in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and the work it ſelf is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated by them, unto themſelves alone, unto them, and <hi>them only,</hi> as they ſuppoſe, it belongs to take care of the propagation of the faith of the Goſpel, with the converſion of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Whatever is done unto this purpoſe by others, they condemn and abhor.</p>
               <p>What do they think of the primitive way of doing it, by perſonal Preaching, Sufferings and Holineſs? Will the <hi>Pope,</hi> his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> undertake this work or way of the diſcharge of it? Chriſt hath appointed no other, the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, knew no other; no other becomes the Goſpel; nor ever had Succeſs. No they abhor and deteſt this way of it.</p>
               <p>What then is to be done? Shall the Truth be denyed? Shall the work be wholely and avowedly laid aſide? neither will this pleaſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſuited unto their honour; wherefore they have erected a <hi>diſmal Image</hi> of it unto the horrible reproach of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>They have indeed provided a double painting for the Image which they have ſet up. The firſt is the conſtant conſult of ſome perſons at <hi>Rome,</hi> which they call <hi>congregatio de propaganda fide,</hi> a Counſel for the Propagation of the Faith, under the effect of whoſe conſultations Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom hath long grieved. And the other is, the <hi>Sending of Miſſionaries</hi> as they call them, or a <hi>Surcharge of Fryars</hi> from their over numerous <hi>Fraternities</hi> upon their errands into remote Nations. But the <hi>Real Image</hi> it ſelf, conſiſts of theſe three parts.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>By theſe, it is that they deſign to propagate the Faith and promote <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> And if Hell it ſelf can invent a more <hi>deformed Image,</hi> and Repreſentation of the ſacred Truth and Work, which it is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of, I am much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Thus have they in the <hi>first way,</hi> carried Chriſtian Religion into the <hi>Indies,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Weſtern Parts of the World,</hi> ſo called.

And this ſavage Cruelty hath made the name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> deteſtable amongſt all that remained of them, that had any Exerciſe of Reaſon; ſome few ſlaviſh Brutes being brought by force to ſubmit unto this new kind of Idolatry. And this we muſt think to be done, in obedience unto that command of <hi>Chriſt. Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel unto every Creature, he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> This is the <hi>deformed Image,</hi> which they have ſet up of Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his holy Commands; whereunto they apply that voice to <hi>Peter</hi> with reſpect unto the eating of all ſorts of Creatures, <hi>Ariſe, Peter, kill and eat.</hi> So have they dealt with thoſe poor Nations whom they have devoured.</p>

               <p>The next part of this <hi>Image,</hi> the next way uſed by them for the propagating of the Faith, and the converſion of them they call <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> is the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> So much hath been declared, and is known there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it is needleſs here to give a Portraicture of it.

               <p>This is that Engine, which hath ſupplyed the <hi>Scarlet Whore</hi> with the blood of Saints, and the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, until ſhe was drunk with it.

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42587:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The <hi>Third Way</hi> they inſiſt on unto this purpoſe, the <hi>third part of this Image</hi> conſiſts in Plots and Contrivances to murder Princes, to embroil Nations in Blood, to ſtir up Sedition unto their Ruine, inveagling and alluring all ſorts of Vicious, Indigent, Ambitious Perſons, into an Aſſociation with them, ſo to introduce the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> in the places which they deſign to ſubvert. This Engine for the Propagation of the Faith, hath been plied with various Succeſſes in many Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and is ſtill at work unto the ſame purpoſe. And hereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all the Arts which they uſe for the infatuation of the Minds of Princes and Great men, all the Baits they lay for others of all ſorts to work them over unto a compliance with their Deſigns.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Parts, I ſay, is that <hi>dreadful Image</hi> made up and compos'd, which they ſet up, embrace and adore, in the room of the <hi>Holy way</hi> for the propagation of the Goſpel appointed by Jeſus Chriſt. In <hi>his way</hi> they can ſee no Beauty, they can expect no ſucceſs; they cannot believe that ever the world will be converted by it, or be brought in ſubjection unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and therefore betake themſelves unto their own. Faith, Prayer, Holineſs, Preaching, Suffering, all in expectation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Preſence and Aſſiſtance of Chriſt, are no ways for efficacy, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and advantage, to be compared unto the <hi>Sword, Inquiſition,</hi> and <hi>under-hand Deſignings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this alſo is that which they call <hi>Zeal for the Glory of God,</hi> and the Honour of Chriſt; another deformed Image which they have brought into Religion. For whereas that Grace conſiſts principally in <hi>poſtponing Self,</hi> and all Self-concerns, with an undervaluation of them, unto the Glory of God, and the ſpecial Duties whereby it may be promoted, this Impious Deſign to deſtroy Mankind by all ways of Subtilty, and Cruelty, unto their own advantage, is ſet up in the room of it.</p>
               <p>But the conſideration of the <hi>Nature and Spirit,</hi> of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and End of the Goſpel,</hi> of the Deſign of <hi>Christ</hi> in it, and by it, is ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Souls of men not utterly infatuated, in an abhorrency of this Image of its Propagation. It is that wherein the <hi>God of this World,</hi> by the help of their Blindneſs and Luſts, hath put a cheat on mankind, and prevailed with them, under a pretence of doing Chriſt Honour, to make the vileſt Repreſentation of him to the World, that can be conceived. If he hath appointed this way for the propagating of the Goſpel, he cannot well be diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Mahomet:</hi> But there is nothing more contrary unto him, nothing that his holy Soul doth more abhor. And had not men loſt all ſpiritual Senſe of the Nature and Ends of the Goſpel, they could never have given up themſelves unto theſe Abominations. For any to ſuppoſe that the Faith of the Goſpel is to be propagated by ſuch Cruelty and Blood, by Art and Subtilty, by Plots, Conſpiracies, and Contrivances, any way but by the <hi>fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> which, unto that end, is the <hi>Power and Wiſdom of God,</hi> is to declare his own Ignorance of it, and inconcernment in it. And
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42587:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> had not men conceived and embraced another Religion, than what is taught therein, or abuſed a pretence thereof unto Ends and Advantages of their own, this Imagination of the propagation of it, had never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place in their Minds, it is ſo <hi>diametrically</hi> oppoſite unto the whole Nature, and all the Ends of it.</p>

               <p>There is yet amongſt them another Image of a <hi>General Principle,</hi> no leſs <hi>horrid</hi> than that before mentioned, and that with reſpect unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Obedience. It is the great foundation of <hi>all Religion,</hi> and in eſpecial of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> That God in all things is to be obeyed abſolutely and univerſally. Of all our Obedience; there is no other Reaſon, but that it is his Will, and is known unto us ſo to be. This follows neceſſarily from the infinite Perfections of the Divine Nature. As the firſt Eſſential Verity he is to be believed in what he reveals above, and againſt all contradiction from pretended Reaſons, or any Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatever; and as he is the only abſolute <hi>Independent Being,</hi> Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Goodneſs, and the Sovereign Lord of all things, he is without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon, Motive, or Inducement, to be <hi>abſolutely obeyed</hi> in all his Commands. An Inſtance whereof we have in <hi>Abraham</hi> offering his <hi>only Son</hi> without diſpute or heſitation, in compliance with a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Command.</p>
               <p>It will ſeem very difficult to frame an <hi>Image</hi> hereof amongſt men, with whom there is not the leaſt ſhadow of theſe Divine Perfections, namely, Eſſential Verity, and abſolute Sovereignty, in conjunction with infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which alone renders <hi>ſuch an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> lawful, uſeful, or ſuitable unto the Principles of our rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But theſe of whom we ſpeak, have not been wanting unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein, eſpecially the principal <hi>Craftmen of this Image-Trade.</hi> The Order of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have made a bold Attempt for the framing of it. Their <hi>Vow of blind Obedience</hi> (as they call it) unto their <hi>Superiors,</hi> whereto they reſign the whole conduct of their Souls, in all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, in all Duties toward God and man, unto their Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Diſpoſal, is a <hi>curſed Image</hi> of this abſolute Obedience unto the Commands of God, which he requireth of us. Hence the Founder of their Order, was not aſhamed in his <hi>Epiſtle ad Fratres Luſitanos,</hi> to urge and preſs this <hi>blind Obedience</hi> from the Example of <hi>Abraham</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obedience unto God, without debate or conſideration; as if the Superiors of the Order were Good and not Evil and Sinful men.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this Honour was reſerved unto God, whilſt this was judged to be his <hi>Prerogative</hi> alone, namely, that his Commands are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things, without Reaſonings and Examinations as unto the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Juſtice and Equity of them, meerly becauſe they are his, which abſolutely and infallibly conclude them good, holy and juſt, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Government of the world, and the Security of men in all their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42587:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> Rights, was ſafely provided for; for he neither <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> command any thing but what is holy, juſt and good. But ſince the Aſcription of ſuch a <hi>Godlike Authority</hi> unto man, as to ſecure <hi>blind Obedience</hi> unto all their Commands, innumerable Evils, in Murders, Seditions and Perjuries, have openly enſued thereon.</p>
               <p>But beſides thoſe particular Evils in matter of Fact, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from this corrupt Fountain, this perſwaſion at once takes away all grounds of Peace and <hi>Security</hi> from Mankind; for who knows what a <hi>Crew or Sort of men,</hi> called the <hi>Jeſuites Superiors,</hi> known only by their reſtleſs Ambition, and evil Practices in the world, may command their <hi>Vaſſals,</hi> who are ſworn to execute whatever they command, without any conſideration whether it be right or wrong, good or evil?</p>
               <p>Let Princes and other great men <hi>flatter themſelves whilſt they pleaſe,</hi> that on one conſideration or other, they ſhall be the Objects only of their kindneſs, if theſe men, according to their Profeſſion, be obliged in conſcience to execute whatever their <hi>Superiors</hi> ſhall command them, no leſs than <hi>Abraham</hi> was to ſacrifice his Son on the Command of God; they hold their Lives at the Mercy, and on the good Nature of theſe <hi>Superiors,</hi> who are always ſafe out of the reach of Revenge.</p>
               <p>It is marvellous that Mankind doth not agree to demoliſh this <hi>curſed Image,</hi> or the Aſcription of a <hi>Godlike Power</hi> unto men, to require blind Obedience unto their Commands, eſpecially conſidering what effects it hath produced in the world. All men know by whoſe Device it was firſt ſet up and erected; by whom, what means, and unto what end it was confirmed and conſecrated; and at this day it is maintained by a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, of an uncertain Extract and Original, like that of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in the <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> their Riſe being generally out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, among the meaneſt and loweſt of the People. Such they are who by the Rules of their Education, are taught to renounce all reſpect unto their Native Countreys, and Alliances therein, but ſo as to make them only the way and matter for the advancement of the intereſt of this new Society. And this ſort of men being nouriſhed from their very firſt entrances into the conduct of the <hi>Society,</hi> unto hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of <hi>Wealth, Honour, Power, Intereſt</hi> in the diſpoſal of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs of Mankind, and the Regulation of the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of men, it is no wonder if with the utmoſt of their Arts and Induſtry, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſet up and preſerve this <hi>Image</hi> which they have erected, from whence they expect all the advantage which they do deſign.

               <p>From theſe <hi>Generals,</hi> I ſhall proceed unto more particular Inſtances; and thoſe for the moſt part in important Principles of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> are moſt concerned. And I ſhall begin with that which is of ſignal Advantage unto the Framers of theſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> as the other alſo are in their degree; for by this craft they have their Livelihood and Wealth, and moſt pernicious to the Souls of other men.</p>
               <p>It is a Principle of Truth, that ſuch as wherein the whole courſe of <hi>Chriſtian Obedience</hi> is concerned, that there is a <hi>Spiritual defilement in Sin:</hi> This the Scripture every where declares, repreſenting the very Nature of it by ſpiritual Uncleanneſs. And this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs</hi> is its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety unto the Holineſs of the Divine Nature, as repreſented unto us in the Law. This <hi>Defilement</hi> is in all men equally by Nature; all are alike born in Sin, and the pollution of it; <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> And it is in all <hi>perſonally,</hi> in various degrees; ſome are more polluted with actual Sins than others, but all are ſo in their degree and meaſure.</p>
               <p>This pollution of Sin muſt be <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>taken away</hi> before our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven; for <hi>no unclean thing ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Sin muſt be deſtroyed in its Nature, Practice, Power and Effects, or we are not <hi>ſaved</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Purification of Sin</hi> is wrought in us <hi>initially</hi> and <hi>gradually</hi> in this <hi>Life,</hi> and accompliſhed in <hi>Death,</hi> when <hi>the Spirits of juſt men are made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a compliance with this work of Gods Grace towards them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they <hi>purifie themſelves,</hi> conſiſts one principal part of the Obedience of Believers in this world, and of the exerciſe of their Faith.</p>
               <p>The principal, internal, immediate efficient cauſe of this purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sins, is the <hi>Blood of Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, cleanſeth us from all our Sins,</hi> 1 John 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our Conſciences from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>He waſheth us in his own Blood,</hi> Rev. 1.5. And there is an external helping Cauſe thereof, which is Trials and Afflictions, made effectual by the Word, and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Death.</p>
               <p>But this way of <hi>purging Sins by the Blood of Chriſt, is myſterious.</hi> There is no diſcerning of its Glory but by ſpiritual Light, no experience of its Power, but by Faith. Hence it is deſpiſed and neglected by the moſt that yet outwardly profeſs the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Men generally think there are a thouſand better ways for the <hi>purging of Sin,</hi> than this <hi>by the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> which they cannot underſtand. See <hi>Micah</hi> 6.6, 7. It is <hi>Myſterious</hi> in the Application of it unto the Souls and Conſciences of Believers by the Holy Ghoſt; it is ſo in the <hi>Spring</hi> of its efficacy, which is the Oblation of it, for a Propitiation, and in its relation unto the new
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42587:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> Covenant, which firſt it eſtabliſheth, and then makes effectual unto this end. The Work of it is <hi>gradual</hi> and unperceptible unto any thing but the eyes of Faith, and diligent ſpiritual Experience.</p>
               <p>Again, It is ſo ordered by Divine Wiſdom, as ſtrictly to require, to begin, excite, and encourage the utmoſt diligence of Believers in a compliance with its efficacy unto the ſame End. What Chriſt did <hi>for</hi> us, he did without us, without our aid or concurrence. As God <hi>made us</hi> without our ſelves, ſo Chriſt <hi>redeemed us;</hi> but what he doth <hi>in us,</hi> he doth alſo <hi>by us;</hi> what he works in a way of <hi>Grace,</hi> we work in a way of <hi>Duty.</hi> And our Duty herein, conſiſts as in the continual exerciſe of all gracious Habits, renewing, changing, and transforming the Soul into the Likeneſs of Chriſt (for he which hopes to ſee him, <hi>purifieth himſelf as he is pure</hi>) ſo alſo in univerſal, permanent, uninterrupted Mortification unto the end, whereof we ſhall ſpeak afterwards. This alſo renders the Work more <hi>Myſterious</hi> and difficult. The improvement of <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> unto the ſame end, is a principal part of the Wiſdom of Faith; without which they can be of no ſpiritual Uſe unto the Souls of men.</p>
               <p>This Notion of the <hi>Defilement of Sin,</hi> and that of the <hi>Neceſſity of its purification,</hi> were retained in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for they could not be loſt, without not only a rejection of the Scripture, but the ſtiffling of natural conceptions about them, which are indelibly fixed in the Conſciences of men. But <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> into the Glory of the thing it ſelf, or the myſtical <hi>Purification</hi> of Sin, with an experience of the power and efficacy of the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as applied unto the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Believers unto that end, by the holy Ghoſt, were loſt amongſt them. In vain ſhall we ſeek for any thing of this Nature, either in their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or their <hi>Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore having loſt the Subſtance of this Truth, and all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its Power, to retain the Uſe of its Name, they have made ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>little Images</hi> of it, <hi>creeping things,</hi> whereunto they aſcribe the power of purging Sin; ſuch as <hi>Holy Water, Pilgrimages, Diſciplines, Maſſes,</hi> and <hi>various commutations.</hi> But they quickly found by experience, that theſe things would neither <hi>purifie</hi> the Heart, nor <hi>pacifie</hi> the Conſciences of ſinners, any more than the Blood of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> could do it under the Law; yea, any more than the <hi>Luſtrations</hi> and <hi>Expiations</hi> of Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathen could effect it. Wherefore they have at length formed a more ſtated and ſpecious <hi>Image</hi> of it, to ſerve all the turns of convinced Sinners; and this is a <hi>Purgatory</hi> after this Life; that is, a <hi>ſubterraneous place,</hi> and various means where, and whereby, the Souls of men are purged from all their Sins, and made meet for Heaven, when the Lord Chriſt thinks meet to ſend <hi>for</hi> them, or the <hi>Pope</hi> judges it fit to ſend them <hi>to him.</hi> Hereunto, let them pretend what they pleaſe, the People under their conduct, do truſt a thouſand times more for the <hi>purging of their Sins,</hi> than unto the Blood of Chriſt: But it is only a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42587:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>curſed Image</hi> of the vertue of it, ſet up to draw off the minds of poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from ſeeking an intereſt in a participation of the efficacy of that blood for that end, which is to be obtained by faith alone. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.</p>
               <p>Only they have placed this <hi>Image</hi> behind the curtain of mortality, that the cheat of it might not be diſcovered; none who find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it, can come back to complain or warn others to take care of themſelves; and it was in an eſpecial manner ſuited unto their deluſion, who lived in pleaſures, or in the purſuit of <hi>unjuſt gain,</hi> without exerciſe of afflictions in this world. From theſe two ſorts of perſons, by this Engine they raiſed a revenue unto themſelves, beyond that of Kings or Princes; for all the endowments of their Religious houſes and Societies, were but commutations for the abatement of <hi>the fire of this Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas in its ſelf, it was a <hi>rotten Poſt,</hi> that could not ſtand or ſubſiſt, they were forced to prop it, with many other imaginations; for unto this end to ſecure work for this Purgatory, they joyned the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Sin into mortal and venial;</hi> not as unto their end, with reſpect unto Faith and Repentance, not as unto the <hi>Degrees</hi> of ſin with reſpect unto the aggravations, but as unto the <hi>nature</hi> of them; ſome of them being ſuch, namely thoſe that are <hi>Venial,</hi> as were capable of a purging <hi>expiation</hi> after this life, though men die without any repentance of them. And when this was done, they have caſt almoſt all the ſins that can be named under this order; And hereon this <hi>Image</hi> is become an Engine to diſappoint the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, and to precipitate ſecure ſinners into eternal Ruin, And to ſtrengthen this deceiving ſecurity, they have added another invention of a certain <hi>ſtorehouſe of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal merits,</hi> the <hi>keys</hi> whereof are committed to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them as he ſees good unto the eaſe and relief of them that are in this Purgatory. For whereas many of their Church and Communion have as they ſay, done more good works then were needful for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (which they have received upon a due ballance of Commutative Juſtice) the <hi>Surpluſage</hi> is committed to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to commute with it, for the puniſhment of their ſins, who are ſent into <hi>purgatory</hi> to ſuffer for them, then which they could have found out no engine more powerful, to evacuate the efficacy of the blood of Chriſt, both as offered and as ſprinkled, and therewith the Doctrine of the Goſpel concerning faith and repentance.</p>
               <p>Moreover, to give it farther countenance (as one-lie muſt be thatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with another, or it will quickly rain through) they have fancied a ſeparation to be made between <hi>guilt and puniſhment,</hi> ſo as that when the <hi>guilt is fully remitted and pardoned,</hi> yet there may puniſhment remain on the account of ſin. For this is the caſe of them in Purgatory, their ſins are pardoned, ſo as that the <hi>Guilt</hi> of them ſhall not bind them over to eternal damnation, though <hi>the wages of ſin is death,</hi> yet they muſt be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42587:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>puniſhed</hi> for the ſins that are forgiven. But as this is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it ſelf, it being utterly impoſſible, there ſhould be any <hi>puniſhment</hi> properly ſo called, but where there is <hi>guilt</hi> as the cauſe of it, ſo it is highly injurious both to the Grace of God and blood of Chriſt, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and giving out ſuch a lame pardon of ſins, as ſhould leave room for puniſhment next to that which is eternal.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>rotten Props,</hi> which they have fixed on the minds of perſons credulous and ſuperſtitious, terrified with guilt and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſupport this tottering <hi>deformed Image,</hi> ſet up in the room of the efficacy of the blood of Chriſt, to purge the ſouls and conſciences of Believers from ſin,</p>
               <p>But that whereby it is principally eſtabliſhed and ſet up, is the <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance, guilt, fear, terrour of conſcience,</hi> accompanied with a love of ſin, that the moſt among them are ſubject and obnoxious unto, being diſquieted, perplexed, and tormented with theſe things, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of the true and only way of their removal and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from them, they greedily embrace this ſorry proviſion for their preſent eaſe and relief, being accommodated unto the utmoſt that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Diabolical craft can extend unto, to abate their fear, eaſe their torments, and to give ſecurity unto their ſuperſtitious minds. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is become to be the life and ſoul of their Religion, diffuſing it ſelf into all the parts and concerns of it, more truſted unto then either God or Chriſt, or the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual light and experience,</hi> with the conſequents of them in <hi>peace with God,</hi> will ſafeguard the minds of Believers from bowing down to this horrid image, though the acknowledgments of its divinity ſhould be impoſed on them with craft and force, otherwiſe it will not be done, for without this, there will a ſtrong inclination and diſpoſition ariſing from a mixture of ſuperſtitious fear and love of ſin, poſſeſs the minds of men to cloſe with this pretended relief and ſatisfaction. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our preſervation herein lies in <hi>Spiritual light,</hi> or an ability of mind, from ſupernatural illumination, to diſcern the Beauty, Glory, and efficacy of the purging of our ſins by the blood of Chriſt, when the glory of the wiſdom and grace of God, of the love and grace of Chriſt of the power of the Holy Ghoſt herein, is made manifeſt unto us, we ſhall deſpiſe all the paintings of this invention, <hi>Dagon</hi> will fall before the <hi>Ark;</hi> and all theſe things do gloriouſly ſhine forth and manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto believers in this miſterious way of purging all our ſins by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Herein will enſue an <hi>experience of the efficacy</hi> of this heavenly truth, in our own ſouls. There is no man whoſe heart and ways are cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt, through the effectual application of it by the Holy Spirit, in the ordinance of the Goſpel, but he hath or may have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing

               <p>It is granted among all Chriſtians, that all <hi>our helps, our relief, our deliverance from ſin, Satan, and the world, are from Chriſt alone.</hi> This is included in all his Relations unto the Church, in all his offices and the diſcharge of them; and is the expreſs Doctrine of the Goſpel. It is no leſs generally acknowledged, at leaſt the Scripture is no leſs clear and poſitive in it, that we receive and derive all our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>of Relief from Chriſt by Faith,</hi> other wayes of the participation of any thing from him, the Scripture knoweth not. Wherefore it is our duty on all occaſions to apply our ſelves unto him by <hi>Faith, for all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, Reliefs and deliverances:</hi> But theſe men can find no life nor power herein, at leaſt if they grant that ſomewhat might be done this way, yet they know not how to do it, being ignorant of the life of Faith and the due exerciſe of it. They muſt have a way more ready and eaſy, expoſed to the capacities and abilities of all ſorts of Perſons good and bad, yea, that will ſerve the turn of the worſt of men unto this end. An <hi>Image</hi> therefore muſt be ſet up for common uſe, inſtead of this ſpiritual application un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt for relief, and this is the making <hi>of the ſign of the Croſs.</hi> Let a man but make the <hi>ſign of the Croſs on his forehead,</hi> his breaſt or the like, which he may as eaſily do as take up or caſt away a ſtraw, and there is no more required to engage Chriſt unto his aſſiſtance at any time. And the vertues which they aſcribe hereunto are innumerable, but this alſo is an <hi>Idol,</hi> a teacher of Lies, invented and ſet up for no other end;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42587:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> but to ſatisfie the carnal minds of men, with a preſumptuous ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the neglect of the ſpiritually laborious exerciſe of Faith, an <hi>Experience</hi> of the work of Faith in the derivation of all ſupplies of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, Grace and Strength, with deliverance and ſupplies from Jeſus Chriſt, will ſecure Believers from giving heed unto this triffling deceit.</p>

               <p>One thing more amongſt many others of the ſame Sort may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; it is a notion of Truth which derives from the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That thoſe <hi>who approach unto God in divine Worſhip, ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that they be pure and clean, without any Offenſive defilements.</hi> This the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves give Teſtimony unto, and God confirmed it in the Inſtitutions of the Law. But what are theſe defilements and pollutions which make us unmeet to approach unto the preſence of God, how and by what means we may be purified and cleanſed from them, the Goſpel alone declares. And it doth, in oppoſition unto all other ways and means of it, plainly reveal, that it is by the <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt upon our Conſciences,</hi> ſo to purge them from <hi>dead Works, that we may ſerve the Living God,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21. But this is a thing myſterious; nothing but ſpiritual Light and ſaving Faith can direct us herein. Men deſtitute of them could never attain an <hi>Experience</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification in the way. Wherefore they retained the notion of Truth it ſelf, but made an <hi>Image</hi> of it for their uſe, with a neglect of the thing it ſelf. And this was the moſt <hi>ludicrous</hi> that could be imagined, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>ſprinkling of themſelves</hi> and others with that they call <hi>Holy Water,</hi> when they go into the places of ſacred Worſhip; which yet alſo they borrowed from the <hi>Pagans;</hi> So ſtupid and ſottiſh are the minds of men ſo dark and ignorant of heavenly things, that they have ſuffered their Souls to be deceived and ruined by ſuch vain ſuperſtitious Trifles.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe hath already proceeded unto a greater length than was at firſt intended; and would be ſo much more, ſhould we look into all parts of this <hi>Chamber of Imagery,</hi> and expoſe to view all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it. I ſhall therefore put a cloſe unto it, in one or two inſtances, wherein the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> doth boaſt it ſelf as retaining the Truth and Power of the Goſpel in a peculiar manner, whereas in very deed, they have deſtroyed them, and ſet up corrupt Images of their own, in their ſtead.</p>

               <head>SECT. XIII.</head>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is the <hi>Doctrine and Grace of Mortification;</hi> That this is not only an important Evangelical Duty, but alſo of indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity unto Salvation, all who have any thing of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in themſelves, muſt acknowledg.</p>
               <p>It is alſo clearly determined in the Scripture, both <hi>what is the nature of it,</hi> with its cauſes, and in what acts and duties it doth conſiſt. For it is frequently declared to be the <hi>crucifying of the Body of Sin with all the Luſts thereof.</hi> For <hi>Mortification</hi> muſt be the bringing of ſomething to <hi>death;</hi> and this is ſin, and the <hi>dying of ſin,</hi> conſiſts in the caſting out of all <hi>vitious habits</hi> and inclinations ariſing from the Original depravation of nature; it is the weakning and graduate extirpation, or deſtruction of them, in their roots, principles, and operations: Whereby the Soul is ſet at liberty to act univerſally from the contrary principle of Spiritual Life and Grace.</p>
               <p>The means on the part of Chriſt, whereby this is wrought and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in believers, is the communication of his Spirit unto them, to make an effectual application of the vertue of his death, unto the death of ſin; for it is <hi>by his Spirit</hi> that we mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, and the fleſh it ſelf, and that as we are implanted by him into the likeneſs of the death of Chriſt. By vertue thereof, we are <hi>crucifyed,</hi> and made dead unto ſin; in the Declaration of which things the Scripture doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
               <p>The means of it on the part of Believers, is the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt, as crucifyed; whereby they derive vertue from him, for the crucifying of the Body of death: And this Exerciſe of Faith is always accompanied with diligence and perſeverance in all holy Duties of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> with <hi>Faſting, Godly Sorrow,</hi> daily renewed Repentance, with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al watch againſt all the Advantages of ſin.</p>
               <p>Herein conſiſts principally that Spiritual <hi>warfare</hi> and conflict that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are called unto, this is all the <hi>killing work</hi> which the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. That of <hi>Killing other men for Religion,</hi> is of a latter date, and another Original. And there is nothing in the way of their Obedience, wherein they have more <hi>experience</hi> of the neceſſity, power, and efficacy of the Graces of the Goſpel.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:42587:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>This Principle of Truth concerning the neceſſity of <hi>Mortification</hi> is retained in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yea, ſhe pretends highly unto it, above any other Chriſtian Society. The <hi>Mortification</hi> of their <hi>Devotioniſts,</hi> is one of the principal Arguments which they plead to draw unwary Souls over unto their Superſtition. Yet in the height of their pretences unto it, they have loſt all experience of its nature with the power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Grace of Chriſts therein, and have therefore framed an Image of it unto themſelves. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They place the eminency and height of it in a <hi>Monaſtical Life,</hi> and pretended Retirement from the World. But this may be, hath been, in all, or the moſt, without the leaſt real work of Mortification in their Souls: For there is nothing required in the ſtricteſt Rules of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Votaries, but may be complyed withal, without the leaſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Operation of the Holy Spirit in their minds, in the application of the vertue of the death of Chriſt unto them; Beſides, the whole courſe of life which they commend under this name, is neither <hi>appointed</hi> in, nor approved by, the Goſpel. And ſome of thoſe who have been moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their ſeverities therein, were men of blood, promoting the cruel ſlaughter of multitudes of Chriſtians upon the account of their profeſſion of the Goſpel, in whom there could be no one Evangelical Grace; for <hi>no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Ways and Means</hi> which they preſcribe and uſe for the attaining of it, are ſuch as are no way directed unto by the Divine Wiſdom of Chriſt in the Scripture; ſuch as multiplied <hi>Confeſſions</hi> to Prieſts, irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ridiculous <hi>Faſtings, Penances, Self-Macerations</hi> of the Body, <hi>unlawful Vows, Self-deviſed Rules of Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> with the like Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets innumerable. Hence whatever their Deſign be, they may ſay of it in the iſſue, what <hi>Aaron</hi> ſaid of his <hi>Idol, I caſt the Gold into the Fire, and there came out this Calf;</hi> they have brought forth only an <hi>Image of Mortification,</hi> diverting the Minds of men from ſeeking after that which is really and ſpiritually ſo. And under this Pretence, they have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>State and Condition of Life,</hi> that hath filled the world with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sins and wickedneſs; and many of thoſe who have attained unto ſome of the higheſt degrees of this Mortification, on their Principles, and by the Means deſigned unto that End, have been made ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for all ſorts of Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the <hi>Mortification</hi> which they retain, and whereof they boaſt, is nothing but a <hi>wretched Image</hi> of that, which is truly ſo, ſubſtituted in its room, and embraced by ſuch, as had never attained any <hi>Experience</hi> of the Nature or Power of Goſpel-Grace in the real Mortification of Sin,</p>

               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid concerning <hi>Good Works;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Duty</hi> whereof they boaſt. The neceſſity of theſe Good Works unto Salvation, according unto mens Opportunities and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is acknowledged by all. And the Glory of our Profeſſion in this World, conſiſteth in our abounding in them; but their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their Nature, their Motives, their Uſe, their Ends are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and limited in the Scripture, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from what may ſeem materially the ſame, in thoſe which may be wrought by Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>In Brief, they are the Acts and Duties of true Believers only; and they are in them Effects of Divine Grace, or the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt; for they are <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath ordained, that they ſhould walk in them.</hi> But the principal Myſtery of their Glory, which the Scripture inſiſts upon, is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are neceſſary, as a Means unto the <hi>Salvation of Believers,</hi> yet are they utterly excluded from any influence unto the <hi>Ju-ſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners;</hi> ſo there was never any Work Evangelically good, performed by any, who were not before freely Juſtified.</p>
               <p>Unto theſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> thoſe with whom we have to do, lay a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement claim, as though they were the only Patrons of them, and Pleaders for them: But they have alſo excluded them out of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and ſet up a <hi>deformed Image</hi> of them, in defiance of God, of Chriſt, and the Goſpel: For the <hi>Works</hi> they plead for, are ſuch, as ſo far proceed from their own <hi>free will,</hi> as to render them <hi>Meritorious</hi> in the ſight of God. They have confined them partly unto Acts of Superſtitious Devotion, partly unto thoſe of Charity, and principally unto thoſe that are not ſo; ſuch are the <hi>Building of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Nunneries,</hi> and ſuch pretended Religious Houſes, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Swarms of Monks and Friers, filling the World with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Debauchery. They make them meritorious, ſatisfactory, yea, ſome of them, which they call of <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> above all that God requireth of us, and the Cauſes of our Juſtification before God. They aſcribe unto them a <hi>Condignity</hi> of the heavenly Reward, making it of <hi>Works,</hi> and ſo not of Grace, with many other defiling Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but whatever is done from theſe Principles, and for theſe Ends, is utterly foreign unto thoſe <hi>good Works</hi> which the Goſpel enjoyneth, as a part of our New or Evangelical Obedience. But having, as in other Caſes, loſt all Senſe and Experience of the Power and efficacy of the Grace of Chriſt, in working Believers unto this Duty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unto the Glory of God, and Benefit of mankind, they have ſet up the <hi>Image</hi> of them, in defiance of Chriſt, his Grace, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>

               <p>Theſe are ſome of the Abominations which are <hi>pourtraied</hi> on the Walls of the <hi>Chamber of Imagery</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and more will be added in the conſideration of the <hi>Image of Jealouſie it ſelf,</hi> which, God willing, ſhall enſue in another way.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Shadows</hi> which they betake themſelves unto, in the loſs of <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> to diſcern the Truth and Glory of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and the want of an <hi>Experience</hi> of their Power and Efficacy unto all the Ends of the Life of God, in their own Minds and Souls. And although they are all of them expreſly condemned in the Letter of the Scripture, which is ſufficient to ſecure the Minds of true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the admiſſion of them, yet their eſtabliſhment againſt all Pleas, Pretences, and Force, for a compliance with them, <hi>depends on their experience of the Power of every Goſpel-Truth, unto its proper End, in communicating unto us the Grace of God, and transforming our Minds into the Image and Likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In handling theſe, I ſhall obſerve this Order; 1. I ſhall ſhew you when <hi>Sorrow is overmuch.</hi> 2. How <hi>overmuch Sorrow doth ſwallow a man up.</hi> 3. What <hi>are the Cauſes of it.</hi> 4. What <hi>is the Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. It is too notorious that overmuch Sorrow for Sin, is not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Caſe of the World. A ſtupid blockiſh Diſpoſition is the common Cauſe of mens perdition. The Plague of a hard Heart and ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience keeps moſt from all due ſenſe of Sin, or Danger, or Miſery, and of all the great and everlaſting Concerns of their guilty Souls. A dead ſleep in ſin doth deprive moſt of the uſe of Senſe and Underſtanding; they do ſome of the outward Acts of Religion, as in a Dream; they are vowed to God in Baptiſm by others, and they profeſs to ſtand to it themſelves; they go to Church, and ſay over the Words of the Creed, and Lords Prayer, and Commandments, they receive the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and all as in a Dream! They take on them to believe that Sin is the moſt hateful thing to God, and hurtful to man, and yet they live in it with delight and obſtinacy; they dream that they repent of it, when no perſwaſion will draw them to forſake it, and while they hate them that would cure them, and will not be as bad and mad as they who feel in them any effectual ſorrow for what is paſt, or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe of their preſent badneſs, or effectual reſolution for a new and holy Life. They dream that there is a Judgment, a Heaven and a Hell; but would they not be more affected with things of ſuch unſpeakable Conſequence if they were awake? would they be wholly taken up with the Matters of the Fleſh and World, and ſcarce have a ſerious thought or word of Eternity, if they were awake? O how ſleepily and ſenſeleſly do they think, and talk, and hear of the great Work of mans Redemption by Chriſt, and of the need of Juſtifying and Sanctifying Grace, and of the Joys and Miſeries of the next Life, and yet they ſay that they believe them! When we preach or talk to them of the greateſt things, with the greateſt evidence, and plainneſs, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we can, we ſpeak as to the dead, or to men aſleep; they have Ears, and hear not; nothing goeth to their hearts. One would think that a man that reads <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Scripture, and believes the everlaſting Glory offered, and the dreadful puniſhment threatned, and the neceſſity of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42587:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> Holineſs to Salvation, and of a Saviour to deliver us from Sin and Hell, and how ſure and near ſuch a paſſage into the unſeen world is to us all, ſhould have much ado to moderate and bear the ſenſe of ſuch overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things. But moſt men ſo little regard or feel them, that they have neither time nor heart to think of them as their Concern, but hear of them as of ſome foreign Land, where they have no intereſt, and which they never think to ſee. Yea, one would think by their ſenſeleſs neglect of preparation, and their worldly minds and lives, that they were aſleep or in jeſt, when they confeſs that they muſt die, and that when they lay their Friends in the Grave, and ſee the Skulls and Bones caſt up, they were but all this while in a Dream, or did not believe that their Turn is near. Could we tell how to waken Sinners, they would come to themſelves, and have other thoughts of theſe great things, and ſhew it quickly by another kind of Life: Awakened Reaſon could never be ſo befooled and beſotted as we ſee the wicked world to be. But God hath an awakening day for all, and he will make the moſt ſenſeleſs ſoul to feel, by Grace or Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And becauſe a hardned Heart is ſo great a part of the Malady and Miſery of the unregenerate, and a <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>tender Heart</hi> is much of the <hi>New Nature</hi> promiſed by Chriſt, many awakened Souls under the work of Converſion, think they can never have Sorrow enough, and that their danger lies in hard-heartedneſs, and they never fear <hi>overmuch ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> till it hath <hi>ſwallowed them up;</hi> yea though there be too much of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes in it, yet if any of it be for ſin, they then cheriſh it as a neceſſary Duty, or at leaſt perceive not the danger of Exceſs; and ſome think thoſe to be the beſt Chriſtians who are moſt in doubts, and fears, and ſorrows, and ſpeak almoſt nothing but uncomfortable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but this is a great miſtake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sorrow</hi> is <hi>overmuch,</hi> when it is fed by a miſtaken Cauſe: All is too much where <hi>none</hi> is due; and great ſorrow is too much when the Cauſe requireth but leſs.</p>
            <p>If a man thinketh that ſomewhat is a Duty, which is no Duty, and then ſorrow for omitting it, ſuch ſorrow is all too much, becauſe it is undue, and cauſed by errour. Many I have known that have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled, becauſe they could not bring themſelves to that length or order of meditation, for which they had neither Ability nor Time. And many becauſe they could not reprove ſin in others, when prudent inſtruction and intimation was more ſuitable than reproof. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are troubled becauſe in their Shops and Callings they think of any thing but God; as if our outward Buſineſs muſt have no thoughts.</p>
            <p>Superſtition always breeds ſuch ſorrows, when men make themſelves Religious Duties which God never made them, and then come ſhort in the performance of them. Many dark Souls are aſſaulted by the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and told that they are in a wrong way; and they muſt take up ſome Errour as a neceſſary Truth, and ſo are caſt into perplexing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and perhaps repent of the Truth which they before owned.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42587:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> Many fearful Chriſtians are troubled about every Meal that they eat, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Cloaths, their Thoughts and Words, thinking or fearing that all is ſinful which is lawful, and that unavoidable infirmities are heinous ſins. All ſuch as theſe are Troubles and Sorrows without Cauſe, and therefore overmuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sorrow</hi> is <hi>overmuch</hi> when it hurteth and overwhelmeth Nature it ſelf, and deſtroyeth bodily Health or Underſtanding. Grace is the due qualification of Nature, and Duty is the right employment of it; but neither of them muſt deſtroy it. As Civil, and Eccleſiaſtick, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Government are for edification, and not for deſtruction, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is perſonal ſelf-government. God will have Mercy, and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and he that would not have us kill or hurt our Neighbour on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, would not have us deſtroy or hurt our ſelves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to love our Neighbour but as our ſelves. As Faſting is a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no further than it tendeth to ſome good, as to expreſs or exerciſe true humiliation, or to mortifie ſome fleſhly Luſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo is it with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin; it is too much when it doth more hurt than good: But of this next.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When Sorrow <hi>ſwalloweth up</hi> the Sinner, it is overmuch, and to be reſtrained: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Paſſions of Grief and Trouble of mind do oft overthrow the ſober and ſound uſe of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> ſo that a mans Judgment is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and perverted by it, and is not in that caſe to be truſted: As a man in raging Anger, ſo one in fear or great trouble of mind, thinks not of things as they are, but as his Paſſion repreſents them, about God and Religion, and about his own Soul, and his Actions, or about his Friends or Enemies, his Judgment is perverted, and uſually falſe; and like an enflamed Eye, thinks all things of the colour which is like it ſelf. When it perverteth Reaſon, it is overmuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Overmuch Sorrow diſableth a man to govern his <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and ungoverned Thoughts muſt needs be both ſinful, and very troubleſom; Grief carrieth them away as in a Torrent: you may almoſt as eaſily keep the Leavs of Trees in quietneſs and order in a bluſtring Wind, as the Thoughts of one in troubling Paſſions. If Reaſon would ſtop them from perplexing Subjects, or turn them to better and ſweeter things, it cannot do it; it hath no power againſt the ſtream of troubling Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Overmuch Sorrow would ſwallow up <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, and greatly hindereth its Exerciſe. They are Matters of unſpeakable Joy which the Goſpel calleth us to believe; and it is wonderful hard for a grieved troubled Soul to believe any thing that is matter of Joy; much leſs of ſo great Joy, as Pardon and Salvation are. Though it dare not flatly give God the Lie, it hardly believes his free and full Promiſes, and the expreſſions of his readineſs to receive all penitent returning Sinners. Paſſionate Grief ſerveth to <hi>feel</hi> ſomewhat contrary to the Grace and Promiſes of the Goſpel; and that <hi>feeling</hi> hinders <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42587:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. Over much Sorrow yet more hindreth <hi>Hope;</hi> when men think that they do believe Gods Word, and that his Promiſes are all true to others, yet cannot they <hi>Hope</hi> for the promiſed Bleſſings to themſelves: Hope is that Grace by which a Soul that <hi>believeth</hi> the Goſpel to be true, doth comfortably expect, that the benefits promiſed ſhall be its own; its an applying Act. The firſt act of Faith ſaith, the Goſpel is true, which promiſeth Grace and Glory through Chriſt: The next act of Faith ſaith I will truſt my Soul and all upon it, and take Chriſt for my Saviour and Help: And then <hi>Hope</hi> ſaith, I hope for this Salvation by him: But Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, overwhelming Sorrow and Trouble, is as great an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this <hi>Hope,</hi> as water is to fire, or ſnow to heat. Deſpair is its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pulſe and breath. Fain ſuch would have hope, but they cannot. All their thoughts are ſuſpitious, and miſgiving, and they can ſee nothing but danger and miſery, and a helpleſs ſtate. And when <hi>Hope,</hi> which is the Anchor of the Soul, is gone, what wonder if they be continually toſt with ſtorms.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Over much ſorrow ſwalloweth up all comfortable Senſe of the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs and Love of God,</hi> and thereby hindereth the Soul from <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Him.</hi> And in this it is an Adverſary to the very Life of Holineſs: It is exceeding hard for ſuch a troubled Soul to apprehend the Goodneſs of God at all; but much harder to judg that he is good and amiable to him: But as a man that in the Deſarts of <hi>Lybia</hi> is ſcorched with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heats of the Sun, and is ready to dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with draught and faintneſs, may confeſs that the Sun is the Life of the Earth, and a Bleſſing to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but it is miſery and death to him; even ſo theſe Souls overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Grief, may ſay that God is good to others, but he ſeems an Enemy to them, and to ſeek their deſtruction: They think he hateth them, and hath forſaken them; and how can they love ſuch a God, who they think doth hate them, and reſolve to damn them, and hath decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to it from Eternity, and brought them into the world for no other end. They that can hardly love an Enemy that doth but defame them, or oppreſs and wrong them, will more hardly love a God, that they believe will damn them, and hath remedileſly appointed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And then it muſt needs follow, that this diſtemper is a <hi>falſe and injurious Judg of all the Word and Works of God, and of all his mercies and corrections.</hi> Whatever ſuch a one reads or hears he thinks it all makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: every ſad Word and Threatning in Scripture, he thinks meaneth him as if it named him. But the Promiſes and Comforts he hath no part in, as if he had been by name excepted. All Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are extenuated and taken for no mercies, as if God intended them all but to make his ſin the greater, and to encreaſe his heavy reckoning and further his damnation: He thinks God doth but ſugar over poiſon to him, and give him all in Hatred, and not in any Love, with a deſign to ſink him the deeper in Hell. And if God correct him, he ſuppoſeth that it is but the beginning of his miſery, and God doth torment him before the time.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:42587:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. And by this you ſee that it is an Enemy to <hi>Thankfulneſs;</hi> it rather reproacheth God for his Mercies, as if they were Injuries, than giveth him any hearty thanks.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And by this you may ſee, that this diſtemper is quite contrary to the <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yea and the <hi>Peace,</hi> in which Gods Kingdom much conſiſteth: Nothing ſeemeth <hi>Joyful</hi> unto ſuch diſtreſſed Souls. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in God</hi> and in <hi>his Word</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> is the <hi>flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9. And all this ſheweth us, that this Diſeaſe is much <hi>contrary to the very Tenor of the Goſpel:</hi> Chriſt came as a Deliverer of the Captives, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to reconcile us to God, and bring us glad Tidings of pardon and everlaſting joy; where the Goſpel was received, it was great rejoycing, and ſo proclaimed by Angels and by men. But all that Chriſt hath done and purchaſed and offered and promiſed ſeems nothing but matter of doubt and ſadneſs, to this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Yea it is a Diſtemper which greatly advantageth Satan to caſt in <hi>Blaſphemous thoughts of God,</hi> as if he were bad, and a hater and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er even of ſuch as fain would pleaſe him. The Deſign of the Devil is to deſcribe God to us as like himſelf, who is a malitious Enemy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to do hurt. And if all men hate the Devil for his hurtfulneſs, would he not draw men to hate and blaſpheme God, if he could make men believe that he is more hurtful. The worſhipping God, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by an Image, is odious to him, becauſe it ſeems to make him like ſuch a Creature as that Image repreſenteth: How much more blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is it to feign him to be like the malicious Devils, <hi>Diminutive low thoughts</hi> of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> as well as of his Greatneſs, is a ſin which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injureth God. As if you ſhould think that he is no better or truſtier than a Father or a Friend; much more to think him ſuch as diſtempered Souls imagine him. You would wrong his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> if you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them as Chriſt doth the falſe Prophets, as hurtful Thorns, and Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Wolves: And is it not worſe to think far worſe than this of God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This overmuch ſorrow doth <hi>unfit</hi> men for all profitable <hi>meditation,</hi> it confounds their thoughts, and turneth them to hurtful Diſtractions and Temptations; and the more they muſe the more they are overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>And it turneth <hi>Prayer</hi> into meer Complaint, inſtead of Child-like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Supplications.</p>
            <p>It quite undiſpoſeth the Soul to <hi>Gods Maſſes;</hi> and eſpecially to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <hi>Sacramental Communion,</hi> and fetcheth greater terror from it, leſt unworthy receiving will but haſten and increaſe their Damnation.</p>

Thus overmuch ſorrow ſwalloweth up.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the cauſes and cure of it</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> With very many there is a great part of the cauſe in diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, weakneſs and diſeaſedneſs of the body, and by it the ſoul is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſabled to any comfortable ſenſe. But the more it ariſeth from ſuch natural neceſſity, it is the leſs ſinful and leſs dangerous to the ſoul, but nevertheleſs troubleſome but the more.</p>
            <p>Three Diſeaſes cauſe overmuch ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that conſiſt in ſuch violent pain, as natural ſtrength is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear: But this being uſually not very long, is not now to be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>natural paſſionateneſs and weakneſs</hi> of that <hi>reaſon</hi> that ſhould quiet paſſion. It is too frequent a caſe with aged perſons that are much debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to be very apt to offence and paſſion: And children cannot chuſe but cry when they are hurt, but it is moſt troubleſome and hurtful in too many <hi>Women</hi> (and ſome men) who are ſo eaſily troubled and hardly quieted, that they have very little power on themſelves, even many that fear God, and that have very found underſtandings and quick wits, have almoſt no more power againſt troubling paſſions, anger and grief, but eſpecially fear, than they have of any other perſons.</p>
            <p>Their very natural temper is a ſtrong diſeaſe, of troubling ſorrow, fear and diſpleaſedneſs. They that are not melancholly, are yet of ſo Childiſh, and ſick, and impatient a temper, that one thing or other is ſtill either diſcontenting, grieving or affrighting them. They are like an Aſpen leaf, ſtill ſhaking with the leaſt motion of the air: The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and moſt patient man cannot pleaſe and juſtifie ſuch a one, a word, yea or a look offendeth them, every ſad ſtory or news or noiſe affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and as children muſt have all that they cry for before they will be quiet, ſo is it with too many ſuch. The caſe is very ſad to thoſe about them, but much more to themſelves. To dwell with the ſick in the houſe of mourning, is leſs uncomfortable. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t yet while reaſon is not overthrown the caſe is not remedileſs nor wholly excuſable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But when the <hi>Brain and Imagination</hi> is Crazed and Reaſon partly overthrown by the Diſeaſe called <hi>Melancholly,</hi> this maketh the cure yet more difficult, for commonly it is the foreſaid Perſons, whoſe natural temper is timerous and paſſionate and apt to diſcontent and grief, who fall ito <hi>Crazedneſs and Melancholly:</hi> And the conjunction of both, the <hi>Natural Temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> and the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> do increaſe the miſery.</p>
            <p>The ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of ſuch diſeaſing <hi>Melancholly,</hi> I have often elſewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42587:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. The <hi>trouble and diſquiet</hi> of the mind doth then become a ſetled habit, they can ſee nothing but matter of fear and trouble: all that they hear or do doth feed it, danger is ſtill before their eyes, all that they read and hear makes againſt them, they can delight in nothing, fearful dreams trouble them when they ſleep, and diſtracted thoughts do keep them long waking, it offends them to ſee another laugh or be merry, they think that every Beggars caſe is happyer then theirs, they will hardly believe that any one elſe is in their caſe, when ſome two or three in a week, or a day, come to me in the ſame caſe, ſo like that you would think it were the ſame perſons caſe which they all expreſs, they have no pleaſure in Relations, Friends, Eſtate or any thing, they think that God hath forſaken them, and that the day of Grace is paſt, and that there is no more hope: they ſay they cannot pray, but howl and groan and God will not hear them; they will not believe that they have any ſincerity and grace; they ſay they cannot repent, they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but that their hearts are utterly hardened: uſually they are afraid leſt they have committed the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; In a word <hi>fears and troubles and almoſt deſpair</hi> are the conſtant temper of their minds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you convince them that they have ſome evidences of ſincerity, and that their fears are cauſeleſs and injurious to themſelves and unto God, and they have nothing to ſay againſt it, yet either it takes of none of their trouble, or elſe it returneth the next day: for the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in their bodily Diſeaſe, quiet them an hundred times, and their ſears and hundred times return.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their miſery is, that <hi>what they think, they cannot chooſe but think:</hi> You may almoſt as well perſwade a man not to ſhake in an Ague, or not to feel when he is pained, as perſwade them to caſt away their ſelf-troubling thoughts, or not to think all the enormous confounding thoughts as they do, they cannot get them out of their heads night or day: tell them that they muſt forbear long muſing, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb them, and they cannot: tell them that they muſt caſt out falſe imaginations out of their minds, when Satan caſts them in, and muſt turn their thoughts to ſomething elſe, and they cannot do it: Their thoughts, and troubles, and fears are gone out of their power, and the more, by how much the more, melancholly and craſed they are.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And when they are grown to this, uſually they ſeem to feel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides themſelves, as it were <hi>ſpeaking in them,</hi> and ſaying this and that to them, and bidding them do this or that, and they will tell you <hi>now it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith this or that,</hi> and tell you when and what it hath ſaid to them, and they will hardly believe how much of it is the diſeaſe of their own imagination.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In this caſe they are exceeding proue to think they have <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> and whatever comes into their minds, they think ſome <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> brought it thither, They uſe to ſay, <hi>This Text of Scripture at ſuch a time was ſet upon my mind, and that Text at another time was ſet on my mind;</hi> when oft the ſence that they took them in was falſe, or a falſe application of it made to themſelves, and perhaps ſeveral Texts apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42587:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> to contrary concluſions, as if one gave them hope, and another contradicted it.</p>
            <p>And ſome of them hereupon are very prone to <hi>Propheſies,</hi> and verily believe that God hath foretold them this or that, till they ſee that it cometh not to paſs, and then they are aſhamed.</p>
            <p>And many of them turn Hereticks and take up errours in Religion, believing verily that God believed them, and ſet ſuch things upon their minds: And ſome of them that were long troubled, get quietneſs and joy by ſuch changes of their opinions, thinking that now they are in Gods way, which they were out of all this while, and therefore it was that they had no comfort: Of theſe I have known divers perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, that have fallen into the clean contrary opinions, ſome have turned <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> and ſome have run too far from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſome have had comfort by turning <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Antinomians,</hi> ſome contrarily called <hi>Arminians,</hi> ſome <hi>Perfectioniſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome have turned from Chriſtianity it ſelf to Infidelity, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the life to come, and have lived in licentious uncleanneſs. But theſe melancholly Hereticks and Apoſtates, uſually by this caſt of their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are not the ſort that I have now to deal with.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But the ſadder better ſort, <hi>feeling</hi> this <hi>talk</hi> and <hi>ſtir</hi> within them, are oft apt to be confident that they are poſſeſſed by the devil, or at leaſt bewitcht, of which I will ſay more anon.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And moſt of them are violently <hi>haunted with blaſphemous injections,</hi> at which they tremble, and yet cannot keep them out of their mind, either they are tempted and haunted to doubt of the Scripture or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or the life to come, or to think ſome ill of God; And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſtrangely urged, as by ſomething in them, to ſpeak ſome <hi>Blaſphemous word of God,</hi> or to renounce him, and they tremble at the ſuggeſtion, and yet it ſtill followeth them, and ſome poor ſouls yield to it, and ſay ſome bad word againſt God, and then as ſoon as it is ſpoken, ſomewhat within them ſaith, now <hi>thy damnation is ſealed, thou haſt ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, there is no hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 When it is far gone they are tempted to lay ſome law upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, never to ſpeak more, or not to eat, and ſome of them have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed themſelves to death.</p>
            <p n="9">9 And when its far gone they oft think that they have apparitions and this and that likeneſs appeareth to them, eſpecially lights in the night about their beds: and ſometimes they are confident that they hear voices and feel ſomething touch or hurt them.</p>
            <p n="10">10 They fly from company, and can do nothing but ſit alone and muſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11 They caſt off all buſineſs, and will not be brought to any diligent labour in their callings.</p>
            <p n="12">12 And when it cometh to extremity, they are weary of their lives, and ſtrongly followed with Temptations to make away them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elves, as if ſomething within them were either urging them either to drown them ſelves or cut their own throats, or hang themſelves, or caſt themſelves headlong, which alaſs too many have done.</p>

               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:42587:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>13 And if they eſcape this when its ripe, they become quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the doleful ſymptomes and effects of melancholly: And therefore how deſireable is it to prevent them, or to be cured while it is but beginning, before they fall into ſo ſad a ſtate.</p>
            <p>And here it is neceſſary that I anſwer the doubt, <hi>whether ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be poſſeſſed with the Devil or not, and how much of all this aforeſaid is from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I muſt tell the melancholly perſon that is ſincere, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Devils Agency in his Caſe, may be more to his comfort than to his deſpair.</p>
            <p>And firſt, we muſt know what is meant by Satans <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> either of the <hi>Body</hi> or the <hi>Soul.</hi> It is not meerly his <hi>Local Preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce</hi> and <hi>Abode</hi> in a man that is called his <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> for we know little of that, how far he is more preſent with a bad man than a good: But it is his <hi>exerciſing Power on a man</hi> by ſuch a <hi>ſtated effectual operation.</hi> As the Spirit of God is <hi>preſent</hi> with the worſt, and maketh many holy Motions to the Souls of the impenitent, but he is a <hi>ſetled powerful Agent</hi> in the Soul of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and ſo is ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in ſuch, and to <hi>poſſeſs them,</hi> by the Habit of Holineſs and Love; even ſo Satan maketh too frequent <hi>Motions</hi> to the Faithful; but he <hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> only the Souls of the ungodly by <hi>predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Habits</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>Senſuality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo alſo he is permitted by God to inflict Perſecutions and Croſſes and ordinary <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> on the juſt, but when he is Gods Executioner of <hi>extraordinary Plagues,</hi> eſpecially on the Head, depriving men of Senſe and Underſtanding, and working above the <hi>bare Nature</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> this is called his <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as moſt evil Motions on the Soul have Satan for their Father, and our own Hearts as the Mothers, ſo moſt or many bodily Diſeaſes are by Satan, permitted by God, though there be Cauſes of them alſo in the Body it ſelf. And when our own Miſcarriages, and Humors, and the Seaſon, Weather, and Accidents may be Cauſes, yet Satan may by theſe be a ſuperiour Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And when his Operations are ſuch as we call a <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> yet he may work by means and bodily diſpoſitions; and ſometimes he worketh quite above the power of the Diſeaſe it ſelf (as when the unlearned ſpeak in ſtrange Languages, and when bewitched Perſons vomit Iron, Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) And ſometime he doth only work by the Diſeaſe it ſelf (as in Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Madneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>

Another great cauſe of ſuch trouble of mind, is the <hi>guilt of ſome great and wilful ſin,</hi> when conſcience is convinced, and yet the foul is not converted, ſin is beloved and yet feared: Gods wrath doth terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them; and yet not enough to overcome their ſin; ſome live in ſecret fraud and robbery, and many in drunkenneſs, in ſecret fleſhly luſts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelf-pollution or fornication, and they know that for ſuch things the wrath of God cometh on the Children of diſobedience; and yet the rage of appetite and luſt prevaileth, and they deſpair and ſin, and while the ſparks of Hell fall on their conſciences, it changeth neither heart nor life, there is ſome more hope of the recovery of theſe, then of dead hearted or unbelieving ſinners, who work uncleanneſs with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, as being paſt feeling, and blinded to defend their ſins, and plead againſt holy obedience to God. Bruitiſhneſs is not ſo bad as <hi>Diaboliſme</hi> and <hi>malignity.</hi> But none of theſe are the perſons ſpoken of in any Text, <hi>Their ſorrow</hi> is not <hi>overmuch</hi> but <hi>too little,</hi> as long as it will not reſtrain them from their ſin.</p>
            <p>But yet if God convert theſe perſons, the ſins which they now live in, may poſſibly hereafter plung their ſouls into ſuch depths of ſorrow, in the review, as may ſwallow them up.</p>
            <p>And when men truly converted, yet dally with the bait, and renew the wounds of their conſciences by their lapſes, it is no wonder if their ſorrows and terrours are renewed. Grievous ſins have faſtened ſo on the conſciences of many, as have caſt them into uncurable melancholly and diſtraction.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But among people fearing God, there is yet another cauſe of Melancholly, and of ſorrowing overmuch; and that is <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>miſtakes in ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Ignorance of the tenor of the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace,</hi> as ſome <hi>Libertines</hi> (called <hi>Antinomians</hi>) more dangerouſly miſtake it, who tell men that <hi>Chriſt hath Repented and believed them, and that they muſt no more queſtion their Faith and Repentance, than they muſt queſtion the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> ſo many better Chriſtians underſtand not that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is tidings of unſpeakable joy to all that will believe it; and that Chriſt and Life are offered freely to them that will accept him, and that no ſins, how great or many ſoever are excepted from pardon, to the ſoul that unfeignedly turneth to God by faith in Chriſt, that whoever will may freely take the water of life, and all that are weary and thirſt are invited to come to him for eaſe and reſt.</p>
            <p>And they ſeem not to underſtand the conditions of forgiveneſs, which is but <hi>true conſent to the pardoning, ſaving</hi> (baptiſmal) <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And many of them are miſtaken about the uſe of ſorrow for ſin, and about the nature of hardneſs of <hi>heart</hi> they think that if their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be not ſo paſſionate as to bring forth tears and greatly to afflict them they are not capable of pardon, though they ſhould conſent to all the pardoning Covenant, and they conſider not that it is not our ſorrow for it ſelf that God delighteth in, but it is the taking down of pride, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42587:141" rendition="simple:additions"/> that ſo much humbling ſenſe of ſin, danger and miſery, as may make us feel the need of Chriſt and mercy, and bring us unfeignedly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be his Diſciples, and to be ſaved upon his Covenant terms. Be ſorrow much or little, if it do this much, the ſinner ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>length of Gods ſorrow,</hi> ſome thinks that the pangs of the new birth muſt be a long continued ſtate, whereas we read in the Scripture, that by the penitent ſinners, the Goſpel was ſtill received ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with joy, as being the gift of Chriſt, and pardon, and everlaſting life; humility and ſelf-loathing muſt continue and increaſe, but our firſt great ſorrows may be ſwallowed up with holy thankfulneſs and joy.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> in Scripture it is taken for ſuch a ſtiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious obſtinacy, as will not be moved from their ſins to obedience, by any of Gods commands or threats, and is called oft an <hi>Iron ſinew,</hi> a <hi>ſtiff neck,</hi> &amp;c, but its never taken from the meer want of <hi>tears or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſorrow</hi> in a man that is willing to obey; the <hi>hard hearted</hi> are the rebellious; ſorrow even for ſin may be overmuch, and a paſſionate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or man may eaſily grieve and weep for the ſin which they will not leave, but obedience cannot be too much.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And abundance are caſt down by <hi>ignorance of themſelves,</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſincerity</hi> which God hath given them, grace is weak in the beſt of us here, and little and weak grace is not very eaſily perceived, for it acteth weakly and unconſtantly, and it is known but by its acts, and weak grace is always joyned with too ſtrong corruption; and all ſin in heart and life is contrary to grace, and doth obſcure it; and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſually have too little knowledge, and are too ſtrange at home, and unskilful in examining and watching their hearts, and keeping its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: And how can any under all theſe hinderances, yet keep any full aſſurance of their own ſincerity; if with muchado they get ſome aſſurances, neglect of duty or coldneſs in it, or yielding to temptation, or unconſtancy in cloſe obedience, will make them queſtion all again, and ready to ſay it was all but hypocriſie, and a ſad and melancholly frame of mind is always apt to conclude the worſe, and hardly brought to ſee any thing that is good and tends to comfort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And in ſuch a caſe, there are too few that know how to fetch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from bare probabilities, when they get not certainty, much leſs from the meer offers of Grace and Salvation, even when they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but they are willing to accept them; and if none ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but thoſe that have <hi>aſſurance</hi> of their <hi>ſincerity and ſalvation,</hi> deſpair would ſwallow up the ſoules of moſt, even of true believers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And <hi>Ignorance</hi> of <hi>other men</hi> increaſeth the fears and ſorrows of ſome: They think by our preaching and writing that we are much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we are: And then they think that they are graceleſs, becauſe they come ſhort of our ſuppoſed meaſures, whereas if they dwelt with us and ſaw our failings, or knew us but as well as we know our ſelves; or ſaw all our ſinful thoughts and vicious diſpoſitions written in our fore-heads, they would be cured of this errour.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42587:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. And <hi>unskilful Teachers</hi> do cauſe the griefs and perplexities of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many; ſome cannot open to them clearly the tenor of the Covenant of grace; ſome are themſelves unacquainted with any ſpiritual heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſolations; and many have no experience of any inward holineſs, and renewal by the Holy Ghoſt, and know not what <hi>ſincerity</hi> is, nor wherein a Saint doth differ from an ungodly ſinner, as wicked decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers make good and bad, to differ but a little; if not the beſt to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the <hi>worſt;</hi> ſo ſome unskilful men do place ſincerity in ſuch things as are not ſo much as duty, as the Papiſts in their manifold inventions and ſuperſtitions, and many Sects in their unſound opinions.</p>
            <p>And ſome unskilfully and unſoundly deſcribe the ſtate of grace, and tell you how far an hypocrite may go, ſo as unjuſtly diſcourageth and confoundeth the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, and cannot amend the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſion of their Books or Teachers;<note n="*" place="margin">One of my Hearers fell diſtracted with reading ſome paſſages in Mr. <hi>Sheepherds ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Beleever,</hi> which were not juſtifiable or ſound.</note> And too many Teachers lay mens comforts, if not Salvation, on controverſies which are paſt their reach, and pronounce hereſie and damnation againſt that which they themſelves underſtand not: even the Chriſtian world theſe one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred, or one thouſand two hundred years is divided into parties, by the Teachers unskilful quarrels about words, which they took in ſeveral ſences. Is it any wonder if the hearers of ſuch are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I have told you the cauſes of <hi>diſtracted ſorrows,</hi> I am now to tell you what is the cure, but alas it is not ſo ſoon done as told, and I ſhall begin where the diſeaſe beginneth, and tell you both what the Patient himſelf muſt do, and what muſt be done by his friends and Teachers.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Look not on the ſinful part of your troubles, either as <hi>better or worſe</hi> than indeed it is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Too many perſons in their ſufferings and ſorrows, think they are only to be pittyed, and take little notice of the ſin that cauſed them, or that they ſtill continue to commit, and too many unskilful friends and Miniſters do only comfort them, when a round chiding and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their ſin ſhould be the better part of the Cure, and if they were more ſenſible how much ſin their is, in their overvaluing the world and not truſting God, and in there hard thoughts of him, and their poor unholy thoughts of his goodneſs, and in their undervaluing the heavenly Glory, which ſhould ſatisfie them in the moſt afflicted State, and in their daily Impatiences, cares, and diſcontents, and in denying the mercies or grace received, this would do more to cure ſome, than words of comfort, when they ſay as <hi>Jonah, I do well to be angry,</hi> and think that all their denials of Grace and diſtracting ſorrows, and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt Gods love and mercy are their duties, its time to make them know how great ſinners they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet when as fooliſhly they think that all theſe ſins are marks of a graceleſs ſtate, and that God will take the Devils temptations for their ſins, and condemn them for that which they abhor, and take their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42587:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> very diſeaſe of melancholly for a crime, this alſo needs confutation and reprehenſion, that they may not by errour cheriſh their paſſions or diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Particularly, <hi>Give not way to a habit of peeviſh impatience;</hi> though it is carnal love to ſomewhat more than to God and Glory which is the damning ſin, yet <hi>Impatience</hi> muſt not paſs for innocence, did you not reckon upon ſufferings, and of bearing the Croſs when you firſt gave up your ſelves to Chriſt: And do you think it ſtrange, look for it, and make it your daily ſtudy to prepare for any tryal that God may bring you to, and then it will not ſurprize you and overwhelm you: Prepare for the loſs of Children and Friends, for the loſs of Goods, and for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Want; prepare for ſlanders, injuries or poyſons, for ſickneſs, pain and death: It is your unpreparedneſs that maketh it ſeem unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>And remember that it is but a vile body that ſuffereth, which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes knew muſt ſuffer death and rot to duſt, and whoever is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſufferings, it is God that tryeth you by it, and when you think that you are only diſpleaſed with men, you are not guiltleſs of murmuring againſt God, or elſe his overruling hand would perſwade you to ſubmiſſive patience.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially make conſcience of a ſetled <hi>diſcontent</hi> of mind: have you not yet much better than you deſerve? And do you forget how many years you have enjoyed undeſerved mercy? <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is a continued reſiſtance of Gods diſpoſing will, that I ſay not ſome rebellion againſt it. Your own wills riſe up againſt the will of God. It is Atheiſtical to think that your ſufferings are not by his providence; and dare you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine againſt God, and continue in ſuch repining, to whom elſe doth it belong to diſpoſe of you and all the world?</p>
            <p>And when you feel <hi>diſtracting cares</hi> for your deliverances, remember that this is not <hi>truſting</hi> God: Care for your own duty and obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but leave it to him what you ſhall have, tormenting care do but add to your afflictions, It is a great mercy of God that he forbiddeth you theſe cares, and promiſeth to care for you: Your Saviour himſelf hath largely, though gently reprehended them <hi>Math.</hi> 6. and told you how ſinful and unprofitable they are, and that your father knoweth what you need, and if he deny it you, it is for juſt cauſe, and if it be to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you, it is yet to profit you, and if you ſubmit to him and accept his guift, he will give you much better than he taketh from you, even Chriſt and everlaſting life.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Set your ſelves more diligently than ever, to overcome the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love of <hi>the world:</hi> It will be a happy uſe of all your troubles, if you can follow them up to the Fountain, and find out what it is that you cannot bear the want or loſs of, and conſequently what it is that you overlove. God is very jealous even when he loveth, againſt every Idol that is loved too much, and with any of that love which is due to him. and if he take them all away, and tear them out of our hands and hearts,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42587:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> it is merciful as well as juſt. I ſpeak not this to thoſe that are troubled only for want of more faith and holineſs and communion with God, and aſſurance of Salvation: Theſe troubles might give them much comfort if they underſtood aright from whence they come and what they ſignifie. For as impatient trouble under worldly croſſes doth prove that a man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the world too much, ſo impatient trouble for want of more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Communion with God doth ſhew, that ſuch are lovers of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and of God. Love goeth before deſire and grief. That which men love they delight in if they have it, and mourn for want of it, and deſire to obtain it. The will is the love: and no man is troubled for want of that which he would not have.</p>
            <p>But the commoneſt cauſe of paſſionate melancholly, is at firſt ſome worldly diſcontent and care, either wants, or croſſes, or the fear of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, or the unſuitableneſs and provocation of ſome related to them, or diſgrace or contempt, do caſt them into paſſionate diſcontent, and ſelfwill cannot bear the denial of ſomething which they would have, and then when the diſcontent hath muddied and diſeaſed a mans mind, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations about his ſoul do come in afterwards, and that which begun on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with worldly croſſes, doth after ſeem to be all about Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or meerly for ſin or want of Grace.</p>
            <p>Why could you not patiently bear the words, the wrongs, the loſſes, the croſſes that did befal you? Why made you ſo great a matter of theſe bodily tranſitory things? Is it not becauſe you overlove them, were you not in good earneſt when you called them vanity, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to leave them to the will of God? would you have God let you alone in ſo great a ſin as the love of the world, or giving any of his due to creatures; If God ſhould not teach you what to love and what to ſet light by, and cure you of ſo dangerous a diſeaſe as a fleſhly earthly mind, he ſhould not ſanctifie you and fit you for heaven, ſouls go not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an arrow is ſhot upward, againſt their inclination; but as fire naturally tendeth upward and earth downward to their like, ſo when holy men are dead, their ſouls have a natural inclination upward, and it is their love that is their inclination; they love God and Heaven, and Holy company and their old godly friends, and holy works, even mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love and the joyful praiſes of <hi>Jehovah:</hi> And this <hi>Spirit and Love</hi> is as a fiery nature, which carrieth them heavenward; and Angels convey them not thither by force, but conduct them as a Bride to her marriage; who is carryed all the way by love.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide the ſouls of wicked men are of a fleſhly world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclination, and love not heavenly works and company, and have nothing in them to carry them to God; but they love worldly traſh and ſenſual beaſtial delights, though they cannot enjoy them, as poor men love riches, and are vexed for want of what they love, and therefore it is no wonder if wicked ſouls do dwell with Devils in the lower regions, and that they make Apparitions here when God permits them, and if holy ſouls be liable to no ſuch deſcent. Love is the Souls poiſe and ſpring, and carrieth ſouls downward or upward accordingly.</p>
            <pb n="281" facs="tcp:42587:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Away then with the earthly fleſhly Love. How long will you ſtay here? And what will Earth and Fleſh do for you? So far as it may be helpful to Holineſs and Heaven, God will not deny it to ſubmiſſive Children; but to <hi>overlove</hi> is to turn from God, and is the dangerous Malady of Souls, and the poiſe that ſinks them down from Heaven. Had you learnt better to forſake all for Chriſt, and to account all but as Loſs and Dung, as <hi>Paul</hi> did (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.) you could more eaſily bear the want of it. When did you ſee any live in diſcontent, and diſtracted with Melancholy, Grief and Cares for want of Dung, or of a Bubble, a Shadow, or a merry Dream? If you will not otherwiſe know the world, God will otherwiſe make you know it to your Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If you are not ſatisfyed that God alone, Chriſt alone, Heaven alone is enough for you, as matter of felicity and full content, go ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Caſe better, and you may be convinced: Go learn better your Catechiſm, and the Principles of Religion, and then you will learn to lay up a Treaſure in heaven, and not on Earth, and to know that its beſt to be with Chriſt, and that death which blaſteth all the glory of the world, and equalleth the rich and the poor, is the common Door to Heaven or Hell: And then Conſcience will not ask you, whether you have lived in pleaſure or in pain, in riches or in want? but whether you have lived to God, or to the Fleſh? for Heaven or for Earth, and what hath had the preheminence in your hearts and Lives. If there be ſhame in Heaven, you will be aſhamed when you are there, that you whined and murmured for want of any thing that the fleſh deſired upon Earth, and went thither grieving becauſe your bodies ſuffered here. Study more to live by Faith on hope, on the unſeen promiſed Glory with Chriſt, and you will patiently endure any Sufferings in the way.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And ſtudy better how great a Sin it is, to ſet our own Wills and Deſires in a diſcontented oppoſition, to the wiſdom, will and providence of God; and to make our Wills inſtead of his, as Gods to our ſelves. Doth not a murmuring heart ſecretly accuſe God: All accuſation of God hath ſome degree of blaſphemy in it: For the accuſer ſuppoſeth that ſomewhat of God is to be blamed; and if you dare not open your mouths to accuſe him, let not the repineings of your hearts accuſe him, know how much of Religion and Holineſs conſiſteth in bringing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſelf-will to a full reſignation, ſubmiſſion and conformity to the Will of God. Till you can reſt in Gods Will, you will never have reſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And ſtudy well how great a Duty it is wholely to <hi>Trust God,</hi> and our bleſſed Redeemer both with Soul and Body, and all we have. Is not infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs to be truſted? Is not a Saviour that came from Heaven into fleſh, to ſave ſinners by ſuch incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ways of Love, to be truſted with that which he hath ſo dearly bought? To whom elſe will you truſt? Is it your ſelves, or your friends? Who
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42587:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> is it that hath kept you all your Lives, and done all for you that is done? Who is it that hath ſaved all the Souls, that are now in Heaven? what is our Chriſtianity but a Life of Faith? And is this your Faith, to diſtract your ſelves with cares and troubles, if God do not fit all his Providences to your Wills: Seek firſt his Kingdom and Righteouſneſs, and he hath promiſed that all other things ſhall be added to you, and not a hair of your head ſhall periſh; for they are all as it were numbred: A Sparrow falls not to the ground without his Providence, and doth he ſet leſs by thoſe that fain would pleaſe him. Believe God, and truſt him, and your Cares and Fears and Griefs will vaniſh.</p>
            <p>O that you knew what a mercy and comfort it is for God to make it your Duty to truſt him: If he had made you no promiſe, this is equal to a promiſe; If he do but bid you <hi>Truſt him,</hi> you may be ſure he will not deceive your Truſt. If a faithful friend that is able to relieve you, do but bid you truſt him for your relief, you will not think that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you. Alaſs, I have friends that durſt truſt me with their Eſtates and Lives and Souls, if they were in my power, and would not fear that I would deſtroy or hurt them, that yet cannot truſt the God of Infinite Goodneſs with them, though he both command them to truſt him; and promiſe that he will never fail them nor forſake them. It is the refuge of my Soul, that quieteth me in my fears, that God my Father and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath commanded me to truſt him with my Body, my health, my liberty, my eſtate, and when Eternity ſeemeth ſtrange and dreadful to me, that he bids me truſt him with my departing Soul! Heaven and Earth are upheld and maintained by him, and ſhall I diſtruſt him?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But it is none but his Children that he will ſave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; And all are his Children that are truly willing to <hi>obey and pleaſe him:</hi> If you are <hi>truly willing</hi> to be <hi>holy,</hi> and to <hi>obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Will,</hi> in a <hi>godly, righteous,</hi> and <hi>ſober Life,</hi> you may <hi>boldly reſt</hi> in his <hi>diſpoſing Will,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in his <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>accepting Will</hi> for he will pardon all our Infirmities through the Merits and Interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. If you would not be ſwallowed up with ſorrow, ſwallow not the Baits of ſinful Pleaſure. Paſſions, and Dulneſs, and defective Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies have their degrees of guilt; but it is <hi>pleaſing Sin</hi> that is the dangerous and deep wounding Sin. O fly from the Baits of Luſt, and Pride, and Ambition, and Covetouſneſs, and an unruly Appetite to Drink or Meat, as you would fly from guilt, and grief, and terror. The more pleaſure you have in Sin, uſually the more ſorrow it will bring you; and the more you know it to be Sn, and Conſcience tells you that God is againſt it, and yet you will go on, and bear down Conſcience, the ſharplier will Conſcience afterward afflict you, and the hardlier will it be quieted when it is awakned to Repentance: yea, when a humbled Soul is pardoned by Grace, and believeth that he is pardoned, he will not eaſily forgive himſelf. The remembrance of the <hi>wilfulneſs</hi> of ſinning, and how poor a Bait prevailed with us, and what Mercies and Motives we bore down, will
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42587:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> make us ſo diſpleaſed and angry with our ſelves, and ſo to loath ſuch naughty hearts, as will not admit a ſpeedy or eaſie reconciliation. Yea, when we remember that we ſinned againſt knowledge, even when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that God did ſee us, and that we offended him, it will keep up long doubts of our Sincerity in the Soul, and make us afraid leſt ſtill we have the ſame hearts, and ſhould again do the ſame if we had the ſame Temptations. Never look for Joy or Peace as long as you live in wilful and beloved Sin: This Thorn muſt be taken out of your hearts before you will be eaſed of the pain; unleſs God leave you to a ſenceleſs heart, and Satan give you a deceitful peace, which doth but prepare for greater ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. But if none of the forementioned Sins cauſe your Sorrows, but they come from the meer perplexities of your mind, about Religion, or the ſtate of your Souls, as fearing Gods wrath for your former ſins, or doubting of your Sincerity and Salvation, then theſe foregoing Reprofs are not meant to ſuch as you; but I ſhall now lay you down your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies; and that is the Cure of that Ignorance and thoſe Errors which cauſe your Troubles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many are perplexed about Controverſies in Religion, while every contending party is confident, add hath a great deal to ſay, which to the ignorant ſeemeth like to Truth, and which the Hearer cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and when each party tells them that their way is the only way, and threatneth Damnation to them if they turn not to them. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay, <hi>There is no Salvation out of our Church;</hi> that is, to none but the Subjects of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> condemn them, and extol their Church; and every Party extols their own. Yea, ſome will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them with Fire and Sword, and ſay, <hi>Be of our Church, or lie in Gaol;</hi> or make their Church it ſelf a Priſon, by driving in the uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unwilling.</p>
            <p>Among all theſe, how ſhall the ignorant know what to chuſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Caſe is ſad, and yet not ſo ſad as the caſe of the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the world, who are quiet in Heatheniſm, or Infidelity, or never trouble themſelves about Religion, but follow the Cuſtoms of their Countreys, and the Princes Laws, that they may not ſuffer. It is ſome ſign of a regard to God and your Salvation, that you are troubled about Religion, and careful to know which is the right; even Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is better than Atheiſtical Indifferency, that will be on the upper ſide, be it what it will. If you caſt Acorns or Pulſe among them, Swine will ſtrive for it; or if it be Carrion, Dogs will fight for it; but if it be Gold or Jewels, Dogs and Swine will never ſtrive for them, but tread them in the dirt: but caſt them before men, and they will be all toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her by the ears for them. Lawyers contend about Law, and Princes about Dominion, which others mind not; and <hi>Religious Perſons</hi> ſtrive about <hi>Religion;</hi> and what wonder is this? It doth but ſhew that they value their Souls and Religion, and that their Underſtandings are yet imper-But
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42587:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> if you will follow theſe plain <hi>Directions,</hi> Controverſies need not break your Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>See that you be true to the Light</hi> and <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which all Mankind is obliged to obſerve. If you had no Scripture nor Chriſtianity, Nature (that is, the works of God) do tell you that <hi>there is a God, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> it tells you that God is abſolutely perfect in Power, Knowledge and Goodneſs, and that man is a reaſonable free Agent made by him, and therefore is his own, and at his Will and Government: It tells you that a mans Actions are not indifferent, but ſome things we ought to do, and ſome things we ought not to do, and that Virtue and Vice, moral Good and Evil do greatly differ; and therefore that there is ſome univerſal Law which obligeth us to the Good, and forbids the Evil; and that this can be none but the Law of the univerſal Governour, which is God; it tells all men, that they owe this God their abſolute Obedience, becauſe he is their moſt wiſe and abſolute Ruler, and that they owe him their chiefeſt Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not only the chief Benefactor, but alſo moſt perfectly amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in himſelf: It tells us, that he hath made us all ſociable Members of one world, and that we owe Love and Helps to one another: It tells us that all this Obedience to God can never be in vain, nor to our loſs; and it tells us that we muſt all die, and that fleſhly pleaſures and this tranſitory world will quickly leave us. There is no more cauſe to doubt of all or any of this, than whether man be man: Be true to this much, and it will be a great help to all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And as to Gods <hi>Supernatural Revelation, hold to Gods Word (the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bible, written by the ſpecial Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, as the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Records of it.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not <hi>Divine Faith, if it reſt not on Divine Revelation;</hi> nor is it <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Obedience, which is not given to Divine Government</hi> or <hi>Command:</hi> Mans word is to be believed but as it deſerveth, with a humane Faith, and mans Law muſt be obeyed according to the meaſure of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a humane Obedience: but theſe are far different from a Divine. There is no univerſal Ruler of all the World or Church, but God; no man is capable of it, nor any Council of men. Gods Law is only in Nature, and in the Holy Scripture, and that being the Law by which he will judge us, it is the Law which is the only Divine Rule of our Faith or Judgment, our Hearts and Lives. Though all in the Scripture is not of equal clearneſs or neceſſity, but a man may be ſaved that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not a thouſand Sentences therein, yet all that is neceſſary to Salvation, is plainly there contained; and Gods Law is perfect to its deſigned Uſe, and needeth no Supplement of mans: Hold cloſe to Scripture-Sufficiency, or you will never know what to hold to. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Canons are far more uncertain, and there is no agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Subjects, which of them are obligatory, and which not; nor any poſſible way to come to an Agrement.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:42587:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>III. Yet uſe <hi>with thankfulneſs</hi> the <hi>help</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> for the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Lawyers, as ſuch, have none of the Legiſlative power, you need their help, to underſtand the Uſe of the Law aright: And though no men have power to make Laws for the Church Univerſal, yet men muſt be our Teachers to underſtand and uſe the Laws of God. We are not born with Faith or Knowledge; we know nothing but what is taught us, except what Senſe or Intuition perceiveth, or Reaſon gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from thence.</p>
            <p>If you ask, <hi>Whom muſt we learn of?</hi> I Anſwer, of thoſe that know, and have learnt themſelves. No Name, or Title, or Relation, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, will enable any man to teach you that which he knoweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Children muſt learn of their Parents and Tutors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. People muſt learn of their able faithful Paſtors and Catechizers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Chriſtians muſt be Teachers by <hi>Charitable Helps</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But Teaching and Law-making are two things. To <hi>Teach</hi> another, is but to ſhew him that ſame Scientifical Evidence of Truth, by which the Teacher knoweth it himſelf, that the Learner may know it as he doth. To ſay, <hi>You ſhall believe that is true which I ſay is true, and that this is the meaning of it,</hi> is not <hi>Teaching,</hi> but <hi>Law-giving;</hi> and to <hi>believe</hi> ſuch an one, is not to <hi>learn</hi> or <hi>know;</hi> though ſome humane Belief of our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is neceſſary to Learners.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Take nothing as neceſſary to the Being of Chriſtianity,</hi> and to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which is not <hi>recorded</hi> in the <hi>Scripture, and hath not been held as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by all true Chriſtians in every Age and Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that we muſt know men firſt to be <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> that by them we may know what Chriſtian Truth is; but the plain Scripture tells all men what Chriſtianity is, and by that we know whom to take for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But if any thing be <hi>new,</hi> and riſen ſince the Apoſtles writing of the Scripture, that can be no Point eſſential to Chriſtianity; elſe Chriſtianity muſt be a mutable thing, and not the ſame now as it was heretofore; or elſe there were no Chriſtians before this Novelty in the world. The Church were not the Church, nor were any man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, if they wanted any eſſential part of Faith or Practice.</p>
            <p>But here take heed of Sophiſters deceit: Though nothing is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, but all ſound Chriſtians have ſtill believed, yet all is not neceſſary, or true, or good, which all good Chriſtians have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or done; much leſs all which the tempted worſer part have held: For though the Eſſence of Chriſtianity have been ever and every where the ſame, yet the Opinions of Chriſtians, and their Miſtakes, and Faults have been none of their imitable Faith or Practice. Humane Nature is eſſentially the ſame in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in all men; but the Diſeaſes of Nature are another thing. If all men have Sin and Error, ſo have all Churches; their Chriſtianity is of God, but the Corruptions and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42587:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> Maladies of Chriſtians are not. You muſt hold nothing but what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of old have held as received from Gods Word; but becauſe they have all ſome Faults and Errors, you muſt not hold and do all thoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Maintain the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, with all true Chriſtians as ſuch,</hi> and live in <hi>Love in the Communion of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, with them that live in the Belief, and in holy Obedience to the Chriſtian Faith and Law. By their Fruits you ſhall know them. The Societies of Malignants, who ſuppreſs true Practical Knowledge and Piety, and hate the beſt men, and cheriſh Wickedneſs, and bloodily perſecute thoſe that in Conſcience obey not their Uſurpations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, are not the Communion of Saints: Wolves, Thorns and Thiſtles are not the Sheep or Vines of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Prefer not any odd or ſingular Sect before the Univerſal Conſent of the Faithful, in your <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Communion,</hi> ſo far as the Judgment of men is to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Though we take not our Faith from the Number of Believers, and though the moſt be uſually none of the beſt, and ſome few are much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than the moſt, and in a Controverſie a few men of ſuch knowledge are to be believed before the multitude, of leſs knowledge, yet Chriſt is the Head of all true Chriſtians, and not of an odd Sect or Party on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and he hath commanded them all to live as Brethren in Love and holy Communion: And in all Sciences, the greater number of agreeing men are liker to be in the right, than ſome ſtragling perſons, who ſhew otherwiſe no more ability than they: At leaſt, which ſide ſoever you like beſt in leſs neceſſary Points, you muſt always be in unity with all true Chriſtians, and not unneceſſarily differ from them.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Never ſet a doubtful Opinion againſt a certain Truth or Duty: reduce not things certain to things uncertain; but contrarily uncertain things to certain: for inſtance, It is certain that you ought to live in Love and Peace with all that are true Chriſtians, and to do good to all, and wrong to none: Let not any doubtful difference make you violate this Rule, and hate, and ſlander, and backbite, and hurt them for a doubtful, indifferent or unneceſſary thing: Set not your Mint or Cummin, Tythes or Ceremonies, againſt Love and Juſtice, and the great and certain things of the Law: It's an ill Sect or Opinion that is againſt the Nature and common Duty of Chriſtianity and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Faithfully ſerve Chriſt as far as you have attained,</hi> and <hi>be true to all the Truth that you know;</hi> ſin not by omiſſion or practice againſt the Knowledge which you have, leſt God in juſtice give up your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to believe a Lie.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:42587:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>IX. Remember that all men on earth are ignorant, and know but as in a Glaſs, and in part, and therefore the beſt have many Errors: No man knoweth the ſmalleſt Graſs or Worm with an adequate perfect knowledge. And if God bear with multitudes of Errors in us all, we muſt bear with ſuch as are tolerable in each other: It's well if men be humble, and teachable, and willing to know. As we have ſeen few more imperfect than the Sects that have aſſerted ſinleſs perfection, ſo we ſee few ſo fallible and erroneous, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Sect, which pleadeth their Infallibility; when they tell you that you muſt believe their Popes and Councils, that you may come to an end of Controverſie: Ask them whether we may here hope for any end of <hi>Ignorance, Errour</hi> and <hi>Sin;</hi> if not, what hope of ending all Controverſies before we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Ignorance is ended? The Controverſies againſt the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Chriſtianity, were ended with us all; when we became true and adult Chriſtians, and the reſt will be leſſened as we grow in knowledge. Divinity is not leſs myſterious than Law and Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies abound.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>Yet ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t not your ſelves in Knowledge, nor ſay we have learnt enough,</hi> but <hi>continue</hi> as Chriſt's Scholars in Learning more and more to the Death: the wiſeſt know little, and may ſtill increaſe. There is a great difference in Excellency, Uſefulneſs and Comfort between men of clear digeſted Knowledge, and confuſed undigeſted Apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe ten Rules practiſed, will ſave you from being perplexed with Doubts and Controverſies of all Pretenders in Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But if your trouble be not about Doctrinal Controverſies, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your <hi>Sins,</hi> or want of Grace, and Spiritual ſtate, digeſt well theſe following Truths and Counſels, and it will cure you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. God's Goodneſs is equal to his Greatneſs; even to that Power that ruleth Heaven and Earth. His Attributes are commenſurate. And Goodneſs will do good to capable Receivers: He loved us when we were Enemies; and he is eſſentially Love it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Chriſt hath freely taken Humane Nature, and made Satisfaction for the Sins of the world, as full as anſwereth his Ends, and ſo full that none ſhall periſh for want of ſufficiency in his Sacrifice and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Upon theſe Merits Chriſt hath made a Law, or Covenant of Grace, forgiving all Sin, and giving freely everlaſting Life to all that will believingly accept it; ſo that all mens Sins are conditionally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Tenor of this Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Condition of Pardon and Life, is not that we ſin no more or that by any price we purchaſe it of God, or by our own works do benefit him, or buy his Grace; but only that we believe him, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accept of the Mercy which he freely giveth us, according to the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42587:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nature of the Gift; that is, that we accept of Chriſt as Chriſt, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, ſanctifie, rule and ſave us.</p>
            <p n="5">V. God hath Commiſſioned his Miniſters to proclaim and offer this Covenant and Grace to all, and earneſtly intreat them in his Name to accept it, and be reconciled to him; he hath excepted none.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. No man that hath this Offer, is damned, but only thoſe that obſtinately refuſe it to the laſt Breath.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Day of Grace is never ſo paſt to any Sinner, but ſtill he may have Chriſt and Pardon if he will; and if he have it not, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not. And the Day of Grace is ſo far from being paſt, that it is ſavingly come to all that are ſo willing; and Grace is ſtill offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed urgently to all.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The <hi>Will</hi> is the <hi>Man</hi> in God's account, and what a man truly would be and have, he is and ſhall have: Conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant, is true Grace and Converſion, and ſuch have right to Chriſt and Life.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The number and greatneſs of former Sin, is no exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pardon of any penitent converted Sinner: God pardoneth great and ſmall to ſuch; where Sin aboundeth, Grace ſuperaboundeth; and much is forgiven, that men may be thankful, and love much.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Repentance is true, though Tears and paſſionate Sorrow be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, when a man had rather leave his Sin than keep it, and ſincerely, though imperfectly endeavoureth fully to overcome it: No Sin ſhall damn a man which he more hateth than loveth, and had truly rather leave than keep, and ſheweth this by true endeavour.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The beſt man hath much evil, and the worſt have ſome good; but it is that which is preferr'd and predominant in the Will, which differenceth the Godly and the wicked. He that in eſtimation, choice, and life performeth God, and Heaven, and Holineſs before the world and the pleaſure of ſin, is a true godly man, and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The beſt have daily need of Pardon, even for the faultineſs of their holieſt Duties, and muſt daily live on Chriſt for pardon.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Even Sin againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, are too oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by regenerate men; for they know more than others do, and their Conſciences are more active: Happy were they indeed if they could be as good as they know they ſhould be, and love God as much as they know they ſhould love him, and were clear, from all the Relicts of Paſſion and Unbelief, which Conſcience tells them are their Sins.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. God will not take Satans Temptations to be our Sins, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our not reſiſting them. Chriſt himſelf was tempted to the moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin, even to fall down to the Devil and worſhip him: God will charge Satans blaſphemous Temptations on himſelf alone.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The Thoughts, and Fears, and Troubles which Melancholy and natural Weakneſs and Diſtemper irreſiſtably cauſeth, hath much more of Bodily Diſeaſe, than of Sin, and therefore is of the leaſt of Sins; and indeed no more Sin than to burn or be thirſty in a Fever, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42587:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> than as ſome Sin did cauſe the Diſeaſe that cauſeth it, or further than there is left ſome power in Reaſon to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Certainty of our Faith and Sincerity is not neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Sincerity of faith it ſelf is neceſſary. He ſhall be ſaved that giveth up himſelf to Chriſt, though he know not that he is ſincere in doing it. Chriſt knoweth his own Grace, when they that have it, know not that it is ſound. It is but few true Chriſtians that attain to certainty of Salvation; for weak Grace clogged with much Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is hardly known, and uſually joyned with fear and doubting.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Probability of Sincerity and Truſt in Chriſt, may cauſe a man juſtly to live and die in Peace and Comfort, without proper certainty; elſe few Chriſtians ſhould live and die in peace; and yet we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that many do ſo. The common Opinion of moſt Church-writers for 400 years after Chriſt, was, that the uncontinued ſort of Chriſtians might fall from a ſtate of Grace, in which had they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, they had been ſaved, and therefore that none but ſtrong confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians at moſt could be certain of Salvation: and many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches ſtill are of that mind, and yet they live not in deſpair or terror. No man is certain that he ſhall not fall as heinouſly as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did; and yet while they have no cauſe to think it likely, they need not live in terror for the uncertainty. No Wife or Child is <hi>certain</hi> that the Husband or Father will not murder them, and yet they may live comfortably, and not fear it.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Though Faith be ſo weak, as to be aſſaulted with doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Goſpel be true, and there be any Life to come; and though our Truſt in Chriſt be not ſtrong enough to baniſh our Fears and Troubles, yet if we ſee ſo much evidence of Credibility in the Goſpel, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a better Life hereafter, as cauſeth us here to fix our Hopes and Choice, and to reſolve for thoſe Hopes to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and let go all the world rather than ſell thoſe Hopes, and live a holy Life to obtain it, this Faith will ſave us.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. But God's Love and Promiſe through Chriſt, is ſo ſure a ground for Faith and Comfort, that it is the great Duty and Intereſt of all men confidently and quietly to truſt him, and then to live in the joy of holy Truſt and Hope.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. If any man doubt of his Salvation becauſe of the greatneſs of his Sin, the way to quietneſs, is preſently to be willing to forſake them. Either he that complaineth is willing to be holy, and forſake his Sin, or not; if you be not willing to leave them, but love them, and would keep them, why do you complain of them, and mourn for that which you ſo much love? If your Child ſhould cry and roar becauſe his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſowr, and yet will not be perſwaded to forbear to eat it, you would not pity him, but whip him as perverſe. But if you are truly willing to leave it, you are already ſaved from its damning guilt.</p>

Bare examining is not alwayes to be done for aſſurance, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to excite and exerciſe much the grace that you would be aſſured of; The way to be ſure that you believe and love God, is to ſtudy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and goodneſs of God, till active Faith aſſure you that you believe, and you love God and Glory till you are aſſured that you love them.</p>

            <p n="24">XXIV. Though we cry out that we cannot believe, and we cannot love God, and we cannot pray aright, Chriſt can help us, without his grace we can do nothing; but his grace is ſufficient for us, and he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his further help when once he hath but made us willing; but hath bid us ask and have, and if any lack wiſdom let him ask it of God, who giveth to all liberally, and upbraideth not with former folly, but gives his ſpirit to them that ask him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that there is ſome uſe of reaſon left, I will give them yet ſome further <hi>Counſel,</hi> and what they cannot do their friends muſt help them to their power, which I ſhall add.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that it ſhould be eaſie for you in your confounding, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoughts, to perceive that your underſtandings are not now ſo ſound and ſtrong as other mens; and therefore be not wiiful and ſelf-conceited, and think not that your thoughts are righter then theirs, but believe wiſer men, and be ruled by them.</p>
            <p>Anſwer me this queſtion; <hi>Do you know any Miniſter or friend that is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than your ſelf?</hi> If you ſay no, how fooliſhly proud are you, if you ſay yea, then ask the Miniſter or friend what he thinketh of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and believe him, and be ruled by him, rather then by your cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do you find that your troubles do you more good or hurt? Do they make you fitter or unfitter to believe and love God, and rejoyce in him, and praiſe him? If you feel that they are againſt all that is good, you may be ſure that they are ſo far from the Devils temptations, and are pleaſing to him, and will you cheriſh or plead for the work of <hi>Satan,</hi> which you find is againſt yourſelves and God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Avoid your muſings, and exerciſe not your thoughts now too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor too much; long Meditation is a duty to ſome, but not to you, no more than it is a mans duty to go to Church that hath his leg broken, or his foot out of joynt: He muſt reſt and eaſe it till it be ſet again and ſtrengthened, you may live in the faith and fear of God, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelf to deep diſturbing thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that will not obey this counſel, their friends muſt rouſe them from their muſings; and call them off to ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore you muſt not be much alone, but always in ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>cheerful Company,</hi> ſolitarineſs doth but cheriſh muſings,</p>
            <p>Nor muſt ſuch be long in ſecret prayer, but more in publick prayer with others.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="892" facs="tcp:42587:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. Let thoſe thoughts which you have, be laid out on the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things: pore not all on your ſelves, and on your diſtempered hearts, the beſt may find there much matter of trouble: As Milſtones wear themſelves if they go when they have no Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; ſo do the thoughts of ſuch as think not of better things then their own hearts, if you have any power of your own thoughts, force them to think moſt of theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The infinite goodneſs of God, who is fuller of Love than the Sun is of light,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the unmeaſurable Love of Chriſt in mans Redemption, and of the ſufficiency of his ſacrifice and merits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of the free Covenant and offer of Grace, which giveth pardon and life to all that do not prefer the pleaſure of ſin before it, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſe it to the laſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of the unconceivable Glory and Joy which all the bleſſed have with Chriſt, and which God hath promiſed with his Oath and Seal, to all that conſent to the Covenant of Grace, and are willing to be ſaved and ruled by Chriſt. Theſe thoughts will cure melancholly fears.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Uſe not your ſelves to a complaining talk, but talk moſt of the great mercies of God which you have received. Dare you deny them? if not, they are not worthier of your diſcourſe than your preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, let not all men know that you are in your troubles, complaining doth but feed them, and it diſcourageth others: Open them to none but your ſecret Councellours and friends, uſe much to ſpeak of the love of God, and the riches of Grace, and it will divert and ſweeten your ſowrer thoughts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Eſpecially when you pray, reſolve to ſpend moſt of your time in Thankſgiving and Praiſing God. If you cannot do it with the joy that you ſhould, yet do it as you can. You have not the power of your comforts, but have you no power of your tongues, ſay not that you are unfit for thanks and praiſes, unleſs you had a praiſing heart and were the Children of God: For every man good and bad is bound to <hi>Praiſe God,</hi> and to be thankful for all that he hath received, and to do it as well as he can rather then leave it undone: And moſt Chriſtians want aſſurance of their Adoption; and muſt they therefore forbear all praiſe and thankſgiving to God. Doing it as you can is the way to be able to do it better: Thanksgiving ſtirreth up thankfulneſs in the heart, but by your objection you may perceive what the Devil driveth at and gets by your melancholly, he would turn you off from all thankfulneſs to God, and from the very mention of his Love and goodneſs in your praiſes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When vexatious or blaſphemous thoughts are thruſt into your mind by Satan, neither give them entertainment nor yet be overmuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at them. 1ſt. Uſe that reaſon and power that is left you, reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to caſt them out, and turn your thoughts to ſomewhat elſe; do not <hi>ſay I cannot:</hi> If you can no otherwiſe command and turn away your thoughts, riſe up and go into ſome company or to ſome employment which will divert you and take them up. Tell me what you would do if
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42587:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> you heard a ſcold in the ſtreet reviling you, or heard an Atheiſt there talk againſt God, would you ſtand ſtill to hear them, or would you talk it out again with them, or rather go from them and diſdain to hear them, or debate the caſe with ſuch as they. Do you in your caſe, when Satan caſts in ugly or deſpairing or murmuring thoughts, go away from them to ſome other thoughts or buſineſs.</p>
            <p>If you cannot do this of your ſelf, tell your friend when the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cometh, and it is his duty who hath the care of you to divert you with ſome other talk or works, or force you into diverting Company.</p>
            <p>Yet be not too much troubled at the temptation; for trouble of mind doth keep the evil matter in your memory, and ſo increaſe it, as pain of a ſore draws the blood and ſpirits to the place. And this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Satan, to give you <hi>troubling thoughts,</hi> and then to cauſe more by being troubled at thoſe, and ſo for one thought and trouble to cauſe another, and that another, and ſo on, as waves in the Sea do follow each other, to be tempted is common to the beſt: I told you to what Idolatry Chriſt was tempted: When you feel ſuch thoughts, thank God that Satan cannot force you to love them, or conſent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Again ſtill remember what a comfortable Evidence you carry about with you, that your ſin is not damning, while you feel that you love it not, but hate it and are weary of it: Scarce any ſort of ſinners have ſo little pleaſure in their ſin as the melancholly, nor ſo little deſire to keep them, and only beloved ſins undo men.</p>
            <p>Be ſure that you live not idly, but in ſome conſtant buſineſs of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calling, ſo far as you have bodily ſtrength, Idleneſs is a conſtant ſin, and labour is a duty: Idleneſs is but the Devils home for temptation, and for unprofitable diſtracting muſings: Labour profiteth others and our ſelves, both ſouls and body need it: Six days muſt you labour, and muſt not eat the bread of idleneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> that muſt alſo feel it, one would think ſhould be diſtracted with griefs and cares, yet few of them fall into the diſeaſe of melancholly, becauſe labour keepeth the body ſound and leaveth them no leiſure for melancholly muſings: whereas in <hi>London</hi> and great Towns, abundance of Women that never ſweat with bodily work, but live in idleneſs (eſpecially when from fulneſs they fall into want) are miſerable objects, continually vexed and near diſtraction with diſcontent and a reſtleſs mind.</p>
            <p>If you will not be perſwaded to buſineſs, your friends if they can ſhould force you to it.</p>
            <p>And if the Devil turn Religious as an Angel of light, and tell you that this is but turning away your thoughts from God, and that worldly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42587:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoughts and buſineſs are unholy and fit for worldly men, tell him that <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocency to dreſs and keep his Garden, and <hi>Noah</hi> that had all the world was to be Husbandman, and <hi>Abraham Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> kept Sheep and Cattle, and <hi>Paul</hi> was a Tent maker, and Chriſt himſelf is juſtly ſuppoſed to have worked at his ſuppoſed Fathers Trade, as he went on fiſhing with his Diſciples: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, idleneſs is diſorderly walking, and be that will not work let him not eat: God made ſouls and body, and hath commanded work to both.</p>
            <p>And if Satan would drive you unſeaſonably upon longer ſecret prayer then you can bear, remember that even ſickneſs will excuſe the ſick from that ſort of duty which they are unable for, and ſo will your diſeaſe: And the unutterable groans of the ſpirit are accepted.</p>
            <p>If you have privacy out of hearing, I would give you this advice, that inſtead of long meditation or long ſecret Prayer, you will ſing a Pſalm of praiſe to God, ſuch as the 23, or the 133, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This will excite your Spirit to that ſort of holy affection, which is much more acceptable to God, and ſuitable to the hopes of a believer, than your repining trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But yet I have not done with the duty of thoſe that take care of diſtreſſed melancholly perſons, eſpecially Husbands to their Wives (for it is much more frequently the diſeaſe of Women than of men) when the diſeaſe diſableth them to help themſelves, the moſt of their helps under God muſt be from others: And this is of two Sorts, 1. In pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent carriage to them. 2. In Medicine and Diet: A little of both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A great part of their cure lyeth in <hi>pleaſing</hi> them, and avoiding all diſpleaſing things as far as lawfully can be done: Diſpleaſedneſs is much of the Diſeaſe, and a Husband that hath ſuch a Wife, is obliged to do his beſt to cure her, both in Charity and by his relative Bond, and for his own peace. It is a great weakneſs in ſome men, that if they have Wives, who by natural paſſionate weakneſs, or by melancholly or crazedneſs, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and will not yield to reaſon, they ſhew their anger at them to their further provocation: You took her in marriage for better and for worſe, for ſickneſs and health: If you have choſen one that, as a Child, muſt have every thing that ſhe cryeth for, and muſt be ſpoken fair, and as it was rockt in the Cradle, or elſe it will be worſe, you muſt condeſcend to do it, and ſo bear the burden which you have choſen, as may not make it heavier to you. Your paſſion and ſourneſs towards a perſon that cannot cure her own unpleaſing carriage, is a more unexcuſable fault and folly than hers, who hath not the power of reaſon as you have.</p>
            <p>If you know any lawful thing that will pleaſe them in ſpeech, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in apparel, in rooms, in attendance, give it them: If you know at what they are diſpleaſed remove it, I ſpeak not of the Diſtracted that muſt be maſtered by forces, but of the ſad and melancholly, could you deviſe how to put them in a pleaſed condition, you might cure them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As much as you can divert them from the thoughts which are their trouble, keep them on ſome other talkes and buſineſs, break in upon
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42587:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> them and interrupt their muſings, rouſe them out of it, but with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving importunity; ſuffer them not to be long alone, get fit company to them, or them to it, eſpecially ſuffer them not to be idle, but drive or draw them to ſome pleaſing works, which may ſtir the body and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the thoughts: If they are addicted to reading, let it not be too long, nor any books that are unfit for them, and rather let another read to them than themſelves: Doctor <hi>Sibbes</hi> Books, and ſome uſeful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Hiſtory or Chronicles, or news of great matters abroad in the world, may do ſomewhat to divert them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Often ſet before them the great truths of the Goſpel which are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to comfort them: And read them informing comforting Books, and live in a loving cheerful manner with them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Chooſe for them a skilful prudent Miniſter of Chriſt, both for their ſecret counſel and publick audience: One that is skilled in ſuch caſes, and one that is peaceable and not contentious, erroneous or fond of odd opinions: one that is rather judicious in his preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than paſſionate, except when he urgeth the Goſpel Doctrines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and then the more fervently the better, and one that they much eſteem and reverence, and will regardfully hear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Labour to convince them frequently, how great a wrong it is to the God of Infinite Love and Mercy, and to a Saviour who hath ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully expreſt his Love, to think hardlier of him than they would do of a Friend, yea or of a moderate Enemy; and ſo hardly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of that Love, which hath been manifeſted by the moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Miracle; Had they but a Father, Husband or Friend that had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his Life for them, and given them all that ever they had, were it not a ſhameful Ingratitude and Injury, to ſuſpect ſtill that they intended all againſt them, and deſigned miſchief to them, and did not love them. How hath God and our Saviour deſerved this: And many that ſay, it is not God that they ſuſpect, but themſelves, do but hide their miſery by this miſtake, while they deny Gods greateſt Mercies, and though they would fain have Chriſt and Grace, will not believe that God who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it them, will give it them; but think he is one that will remedileſly damn a poor Soul that deſireth to pleaſe him, and had rather have his Grace, than all the ſinful pleaſures of the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Carry them oft abroad into ſtrange Company; uſually they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſtrangers, and ſtrang Faces do divert them, eſpecially travelling into other parts, if they can bear the Motion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Its a uſeful way if you can to engage them in comforting others, that are deeper in Diſtreſſes than they: For this will tell them, that their Caſe is not ſingular, and they will ſpeak to themſelves, while they ſpeak to others. One of the chief means which cured my fears of my Souls Condition about Forty eight years ago, was oft comforting others that had the ſame doubts, whoſe Lives perſwaded me of their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And it would be a pretty diverſion to ſend to them ſome perſon that is in ſome Error, which they are moſt againſt, to diſpute it with them,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42587:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> that while they whet their wits to convince them, and confute them, it may turn their thoughts from their own Diſtreſs. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

If other means will not do, neglect not Phyſick; and though they will be averſe to it, as believing that the Diſeaſe is only in the mind they muſt be perſwaded or forced to it. I have known the Lady deep in Melancholly, who a long time would neither ſpeak nor take Phyſick, nor endure her Husband to go out of the room; and with the reſtraint and grief he dyed, and ſhe was cured by Phyſick put down her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is by means and humours in us that he worketh.</p>
            <p>But chooſe a Phyſitian that is ſpecially skill'd in this Diſeaſe, and hath cured many others; meddle not with Woemen and ignorant boaſters; nor with young, unexperienced men, nor with haſty, buſie, overdoing, ventrous men, that cannot have time to ſtudy the Patients Temper and Diſeaſe; but chuſe experienced, cautelous men.</p>
            <p>Medicinal Remedies and Theological uſe not to be given together by the ſame hand; but in this caſe of perfect complication of the Maladies of Mind and Body; I think it not unfit, if I do it not unskilfully: My advice is, that they that can have an ancient, skilful, experienced, honeſt, careful, cautelous Phiſitian, neglect not to uſe him, nor meddle with any of the medicines which I hereafter mention, nor with any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts whatever, but by their Phiſitians Advice; for there is ſo great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of bodily Temperatures, Age and many Accidents, and of the roots and cauſes of the ſame Symptoms, as that the ſame Medicine may cure one and hurt another, and may cure the ſame man at one time which at another time it may hurt; Skill in managing of it doth much of the Cure; and not the Medicine without it.</p>
            <p>But yet becauſe there are Multitudes of perſons ſo very poor, that they cannot give a ſhilling to a Phyſitian, and the dearneſs of Phiſitians and Apothecaries ſo diſcourageth them, who have not money, that they do not ſeek to any for helps, but ſome Woemen that tell them of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; And there are many in the Countries that are quite out of the reach of a skilful phyſitian; And becauſe there are now ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Empricks and young, unexperienced Phyſitians, that will raſhly venture, before they throughly underſtand the body or the Diſeaſe; And becauſe overdoing and venturing raſhly kills ſo many: For theſe Reaſons I will add a few ſafe and cheap Medicines, which the poor may make themſelves, and which will not cauſe much loathing to their ſtomacks; though I venture on the Cenſure of ſome Phyſitians; I am none my ſelf, but I ſee many ſcore much younger than I that venture much farther,

            <p>The Diſeaſe called Melancholly is formally in the Spirits, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper unfits them for their office, in ſerving the Imagination, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, memory and affections; ſo by their diſtemper the <hi>thinking fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> is diſeaſed, and becomes like an inflamed eye, or a foot that is ſprained or out of joynt, diſabled for its proper work.</p>
            <p>The matter which is the root and foundation, is uſually a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Maſs of Blood, which is the Vehicle of the ſpirits, and that is uſually accompanied with ſome diſeaſes of the Stomach, Spleen, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or other parts which are for the due concoxion, motion, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the blood: which Diſeaſes are ſo various that they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the ſame in many perſons, and hardly known to the wiſeſt phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: The Spleen is moſt commonly accuſed, and often guilty, and the Stomack, Pancreas, Meſentery, Omentum, Liver, yea and Reigns not rarely are the root, ſometimes by obſtructing humors, and that of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualities, and ſometimes by Stones, and ſometimes by various ſorts of humours, and ſometime by Veſicles; But obſtructed if not tumified Spleens are moſt ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Such a black diſtinct humour called Melancholly which hath of old been accuſed, is rarely, if ever found in any, unleſs you will call either blood, or excrementitious humours by that name, which are grown black by mortification, for want of motion and ſpirits: But the blood it ſelf may be called Melancholly Blood, when it hath contracted that diſtemper and pravity by feculency, ſluggiſhneſs or aduſtion, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it to the Melancholly effects.</p>
            <p>But ſometimes perſons that are ſound, are ſuddenly caſt into Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly by a fright, or by the death of a friend, or by ſome great loſs or croſs, or ſome ſad Tydings, even in an hour; which ſhews that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not always from any humour called Melancholly, nor for any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſeaſe at all.</p>
            <p>But the very act of the mind doth ſuddenly diſorder the paſſions, and perturbe the Spirits, and the Diſturbed Spirits in time vitiate the blood which containeth them, and the vitiated blood doth in time vitiate the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and parts which it paſſeth through; and ſo the diſeaſe begining in the Senſes and Soul, doth draw firſt the Spirits, and then the humors, and then the parts, into the Fellowſhip, and Soul and Body are ſick together.</p>
            <p>And it is of great uſe to the Phyſitian to know where the Depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did begin, whether in the mind or in the body, and if in the body, whether in the blood or in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> for the cure muſt be fitted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>And yet the Melancholly Brains may be eaſed, and the mental depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation much kept under, though an obſtructed, yea a ſcarrhifyed Spleen continue uncured many years.</p>

            <p n="1">I. Right uſage and diet are a great part of the Cure: Of the firſt I ſpake before. The Patient muſt be pleaſed, delighted; dealt with as capable, kept from ſolitude and from muſing, and from ſad and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling words and things, and their objections wiſely anſwered; and their judgments in Religion kept from troubling miſtakes, by right informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially they muſt be kept in diverting buſineſs, and if it could be hard labour, even to good tranſpiration and ſweat, to actuate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, and purifie the blood, and excite the igneous ſpirits (which are the inſtruments of the motion and purification of the blood, and of life it ſelf) it would greatly help the Cure, eſpecially ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe twice a day, before Dinner and Supper, an hour or two together, diſcipate and concoct indigeſted matter, excit natural heat, and expels excrements.</p>
            <p>As to Diet, it muſt as Phyſick be fitted to the caſe of the body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is ſometimes in dry bodies, and ſometime in thoſe that are moiſt and fat. It is ſometime in overheated blood, and ſometime in that which is overcold and ſluggiſh; And theſe muſt have quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cures. You may thus perceive the differences in the main: One ſort of Melancholly <hi>Perſons</hi> are only ſad, miſgiving, fearful of troubled thoughts, deſpairing, as undone, and ſolitary muſing, and cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and comforted, much ſilent and dull to action, and will hardly ſtir, rather over cold, than hot, troubled with wind and ill dige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ion.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſort that have overheated blood, that are fierce, talkative, bold, boaſting, laughing, that have ſeeming viſions and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unruly, confident, and theſe muſt have another manner of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and are almoſt mad already.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that have dry lean bodies, muſt have a moiſter dyet and medicine, than the cold, moiſt and fat.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the moſt part all of them are meerly melancholly, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verheated near to madneſs, ſhould eat but ſparingly, ſo as may not ſpoil digeſtion (though ſome of them have a greedy Appetite) they ſhould forbear Cheeſe and Beef, and Swines Fleſh and raw Fruits, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not be over curious in the quality.</p>
            <p>But thoſe that have hot and dry bodies ſhould avoid faſting, and eat as much as they can well digeſt (but not more) and ſhould eat boyled Burrage and Lettice and Stew'd Prunes, Stew'd or Roſted Apples half an hour before meat, and raw Apples, if experience of windineſs or Rheum forbid it nor.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Be ſure that they taſte no Brandy or hot waters, unleſs you would have them preſently ſtark Mad: no nor any hot Wines, ſtrong Liquors or aromatick things; ſuch as Ginger, Pepper, Cloves, or any of the like, nor Muſtard, Horſe-Radiſh, Garlike, Onyons, or any biting thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them purge much with <hi>Sena</hi> in <hi>Whey:</hi> Take three Gallons of clarified whey, put in it two handful of Balm, and as much fumitory (if the time of years ſerve) and as much Borage, boil it to two Gallons, and put it into a ſtean Pot of earth that hath a Spigot at the bottom, (or a ſmall barrel) and put into it in a thin Canvaſs Bag, two ounces of <hi>Sena,</hi> an ounce of <hi>Epithyme,</hi> an ounce of bruiſed <hi>Anniſeed,</hi> and an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ground <hi>Ivie</hi> (called <hi>Ale-hoof</hi>) bruiſed, and two gads of Steel to ſink it; when it hath ſtood two days or leſs, drink a Pint every morning in bed, and lie an hour after it, and if it give not three ſtools, drink near a pint more at five a Clock, continue this three weeks at leaſt every day, having another veſſel ready when the firſt is done.</p>
            <p>Or elſe boyl all the ſame herbs in three points of Whey to half the quantity, ſtrein it, and put in it three drams of <hi>Senna,</hi> and a dram of bruiſed <hi>Anniſeed:</hi> let it ſtand cold an hour and half, and after warm on gentle Embres one hour: drink it the next morning, and ſo on for three weeks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Boyl ſix ſliced Pippens or Permains in three pints of Whey to a quart: ſtrein it and drink a pint every morning in bed (and if you can ſleep an hour after it) and the other pint at night, inſtead of other Breakfaſt or Supper: Do this many weeks when you take not the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Whey.</p>
            <p>And if you drink the like inſtead of beer, at Dinner to a hot dry body it is beſt.</p>

            <p>If it be a weak thin body, he may take it with intermiſſion as he is able, and forbear every third and fourth day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe Dyet Drinks are not all ſo effectual as this that followeth, but eaſier to moſt Stomachs: but the deeper melancholly perſons were better take the next.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Take this potion in this manner three next days together, every week for a body that can bear it, in ordinary <hi>Melancholly</hi> for ſeven weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in old obſtinate <hi>Melancholly</hi> for twelve or fourteen weeks: But if it be a body not full and ſtrong enough to bear three days, take it the two next days every week: It gripeth more than the ordinary ways of uſing <hi>Senna,</hi> but that need not be feared, for it never brings the <hi>bloody-Flux</hi> nor uſeth to weaken: And the griping doth good, by drawing down the troubling matter from the head into the common paſſages.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>The Holy Ghoſt took care in the conception of Chriſt, that his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature ſhould not be in the leaſt defiled, and his whole life was perfectly free from ſin, he did no evil, neither was guile found in his mouth, and his heart was alwayes pure.

But how came it to paſs that Chriſt did not ſink under ſuch a burthen? The firſt ſin of the firſt man, was enough to ſink all the world into Hell, how could Chriſt bear up under all the ſins of ſo great a multitude? The reaſon is becauſe he is God; the blood of Chriſt is the blood of God, how loud does it cry for Pardon and Salvation, and how eaſily does it drown the cry of ſin for vengeance? The blood and ſufferings of Chriſt applied and relyed on by Faith, juſtifie the ſinner, ſilence Satan the accuſer, purge the conſcience from dead works, and open a way into the holieſt of all, by the Croſs of Chriſt we are to climb up to the Throne of Glory. The more the death of Chriſt is ſtudied, the Spirit will be more contrite, the heart more clean, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more calm and quiet. The death of Chriſt puts the ſin to death, but delivers the ſinner from it.</p>

If Chriſt were better known, this day would be more longed for by the Saints. Innocency will then be cleared, all enemies more then conquered, ſalvation will be perfected, the whole Church of Chriſt with all its members glorified, Col. 3:4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> Thus you ſee what it is to grow in the knowledge of Chriſt; and the telling you this, is indeed a directing you how to grow in this knowledge.</p>

            <p>In the third place the <hi>Directions</hi> follow, <hi>how you may increaſe and grow in the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The directions are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be <hi>ſenſible of your remaining ignorance,</hi> and how great the hindrance is, how great the harm is, that is the effect of it. You that are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light and of the day have much of night and darkneſs in you A perfect day you cannot indeed expect in this world, but that 'tis poſſible that your darkneſs may be much more diſpell'd, and 'tis your fault if it be not. So far as darkneſs remains, the Prince of darkneſs has Power, the world has an advantage; and there is danger of being reduced to the works of darkneſs. The want of greater light, is the cauſe of doubts and fears, diſconſolateneſs and confuſion. How little do you know of Chriſt in compariſon of what you ought or might? Are you got beyond the ſurface of Goſpel Myſteries? how far from ſearching into the heart of them, and diſcerning the depths of wiſdom, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th of love in them? Hence it is, that your admiration and affection are no greater. You are engaged in a warfare, 'tis dangerous fighting in the dark, eſpecially with an enemy that fights beſt there. You are travelling in a very narrow way, the leſs of light is in you; you will find it the more difficult to keep this way. For ſhame be not Babes in knowledge <hi>but in underſtanding be ye men,</hi> 1 Cor. 14:20. Let it very much humble you to conſider the ſmall progreſs you have made in knowledge, notwithſtanding the great advantages you have had of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Compare <hi>all other Knowledge and this Knowledge of Christ together,</hi> and ſee the <hi>vaſt difference in point of excellency;</hi> and this will ſtir you up to grow therein. The Philoſophers of old, how reſtleſs were their minds, how endleſs their inquiries! the farther they went, the more they were puz'led; and after long ſtudy they came to underſtand that they fully underſtood nothing. That Wiſe King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after he had diligently employed his large underſtanding about humane knowledge; he cryes out as a man exceedingly vexed and diſappointed. Eccleſ. 1:18. <hi>In much Wiſdom there is much grief, and he that increaſes knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes ſorrow.</hi> But the knowledge of Chriſt is of another nature. He that rightly underſtands the Lord Jeſus, underſtands how to have his guilt removed, his heart renewed, his conſcience calmed, his Soul ſecured, and that for ever. This knowledge is not a vexation but a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Spirit, both becauſe of its certainty, and becauſe of the ſuperabundant grace and fulneſs in Chriſt who is known. Here it may truly be ſaid, <hi>Intellectus eſt in quiete;</hi> the better Chriſt is underſtood, the more the Soul that underſtands him is at reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You muſt not <hi>lean to your own parts and underſtandings.</hi> Men of the greateſt natural capacities, have been men of the greateſt miſtakes, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42587:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> the fooleſt errours; and herein they have embraced for the truths of Chriſt, and the reaſon is, becauſe their hearts being proud, God thwarted them, and their pride blinded them. In your ordinary ſecular affairs, 'tis not ſafe to confide in your own wiſdom; but even here you are <hi>to acknowledge God.</hi> Certainly then when ſearching into the Myſteries of the Goſpel, you muſt be ſenſible that the ſharpeſt underſtanding has need of illumination from above. You muſt indeed <hi>be fools that you may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3:18. A ſight of your folly and weakneſs muſt make and keep you very humble.

            <p n="4">4. Heedfully <hi>attend to the word of the truth of the Goſpel;</hi> this is the great means to infoſe and to increaſe the knowledge of Chriſt. 'Tis called <hi>the word of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3:16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom.</hi> Becauſe Chriſt is the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and the <hi>principal ſubject</hi> therein treated of.

Improve the knowledg of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with reference <hi>to God himſelf.</hi> God out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very dreadful; thus conſidered, ſinful man muſt look upon him as the Devils do, <hi>and tremble, Jam.</hi> 2.19. He has fury in his Face, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in his mouth, and a glittering Sword in his hand, and what fleſh can ſtand before him. But you that are Believers are to look upon him as he is in <hi>Christ,</hi> now his wrath is taken away, he is the God of Love and Peace and Grace and comfort, you may diſcern his bowels yearning towards you, his everlaſting arm embracing you, his Language is moſt ſweet and full of kindneſs: nay He <hi>ſwears</hi> he will bleſs you with all ſorts of bleſſings, but eſpecially with the beſt, namely ſpiritual and everlaſting. Under the Old Teſtament God was called the Lord that <hi>brought Iſrael out of Aegypt.</hi> Afterwards, the Lord that brought <hi>Judah out of the Land of the North.</hi> But under the New Teſtament, he is ſtyled again, <hi>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.3 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe that are converſant in the ſacred Scriptures, do find, that the flouriſhing ſtate of ungodly men, and the afflicted condition of gracious Preſons, hath proved to ſome of the Saints ſo hard a knot, as they have gone to God for the untying of it, and to others it hath been the occaſion of ſo furious and violent temptations, as had almoſt tript up their heels, and broken the neck of their Religion.

Both thoſe in the Earth, by which ſome underſtand the Continent, and thoſe in the Iſles, England, Scotland, and Ireland among the reſt; or if you pleaſe, you may underſtand the Gentiles, becauſe that paſſage of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42:4. <hi>The Iſles ſhall waite for his Law,</hi> is by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt rendered thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12:21. <hi>In his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We have here the manner how the Lord adminiſters his Kingdoms, and mannageth his Government, and that is laid down in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, with terrible majeſty and myſteriouſneſs, this you have in the former part of the ſecond Verſe. <hi>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him.</hi> Which words do intimate to us the tremendous majeſty of the Lord,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42587:165" rendition="simple:additions"/> which may well ſtrike an awe upon his Subjects and friends, and much more fill his enemies with dread and horrour. He was terrible at his giving forth the fiery Law upon Mount Sinai. As we read <hi>Deut.</hi> 11:4. <hi>The Mountain burnt with fire unto the midſt of Heaven with darkneſs, Clouds, and thick darkneſs.</hi> So he is and will be ſtill in his preſent and future ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and diſpenſations. <hi>Mala.</hi> 3:2. <hi>Who ſhall abide the day of his coming, and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth;</hi> well may that queſtion be propounded, for <hi>Mat.</hi> 12:3. <hi>His Fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and gather his wheat into the garner, but burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as theſe Clouds and darkneſs do ſignifie the terrible Majeſty, ſo the myſteriouſneſs of his proceedings. He often goeth ſo much out of our ſight, that we are unable to give an account of what he doth or what he is about to do. Frequently the Pillar of divine Providence is dark throughout, to Iſraelites as well as Egyptians, ſo that his own People underſtand not the Riddles till he is pleaſed to be his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, and ſo lead them into his Secrets. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77:19. <hi>His way is in the Sea, and his path in the great Waters, and his footſteps are not known, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord mannageth his Kingdom and Government with perfect equity and unſpotted Juſtice. <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> Righteouſneſs, whereby he preſerves, ſaves and rewards the good Judgment, whereby he puniſhes, confounds, and deſtroyes the wicked. Theſe are the habitation of his Throne, his Tribunal, his Seat of Judicature. Theſe are the Baſis or foundation, which give unto his Throne is <hi>(recritudinem &amp; ſtabilitatem)</hi> rectitude and eſtabliſhment. His Throne is eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs, and the Scepter of his Kingdom is a right Scepter. Though there be Clouds, yet no blemiſhes, though darkneſs, yet no deformities. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92:15. <hi>The Lord is upright, he is our Rock, there is no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> The Doctrine I ſhall ſpeak to is this:</p>

               </label> I anſwer. <hi>Government is the exerting or putting forth of that Power which any one is juſtly cloathed with, for the ordering and directing of Perſons, and things to their right and proper ends.</hi> In this deſcription of Government are three things to be conſidered and ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all Government there is an end fixed and aimed at.</hi> Thus it is in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick or Family Government, which Parents have over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by nature, and Maſters over their Servants by vertue of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42587:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> The end of that Government is the good of the Family, and every one that is a member thereof. The Parent or Maſter ought not to be wholly addicted to himſelf, nor to aime ſolely at his own honour; pleaſure and advantage, but to deſire, ſtudy, and by all lawful means to promote the good and welfare of the whole. And juſt ſo it is with Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Government, both in Cities and Provinces, and Kingdoms or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. When People did at firſt excogitate and conſtitute ſuch or ſuch a form of Government, and place one or more at the Helm, and ſubmitted themſelves to him or them, no rational man can doubt, but it was for ſome wiſe end. Government and Governours are not ſet up for nothing, but for an end; which <hi>end</hi> is either <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>ultimate,</hi> or <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate.</hi> The ſupreme and ultimate end is, and ought and deſerves to be the glory of God, the exalting of his Name, the preſerving, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and inlarging of his intereſt, the maintaining and promoting of Religion and Godlineſs. None can ſhoot at a fairer mark, nor drive a nobler deſign; this is worthy of men, of the beſt and greateſt men: It is the great end which God himſelf aimes at in all the works of his Hands. He both made all things for himſelf, and for himſelf likewiſe he doth uphold and order them. And unto this end all Magiſtrates are in duty bound to have an eye, and direct their rule and all their actions. This is the great work of their place, the main and principal buſineſs of their Office. The good Lord give them all an heart to conſider it, and to act accordingly. As they rule by God, ſo they are obliged to rule for him; they ought not ſo much to deſign the lifting up of themſelves, as the lifting up the Name of God and Chriſt in the world, eſpecially in their own Dominions. That Magiſtrate who doth not make the glory of God his principal end, is himſelf degenerated into a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>The inferior and ſubordinate end is the good of the Communities, the happineſs and welfare of the whole Country, the peace, comfort and proſperitie of all the People, over whom Governours are ſet. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate is to his Dominions what the Head is to the body natural, and ſo influence belongs to him as well as preeminence, he is engaged to think, contrive, ſtudy, care, order, and provide for the comfort of the body, and all the members of it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> for a fourfold good, as learned <hi>Partus</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>bonum naturale,</hi> for natural good, that he may ſecure thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and life from danger, and thy outward Liberty, comforts and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Sons of violence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>bonum morale,</hi> for moral good, that he may curb thy unruly paſſions, and baſe luſts, and reſtraine or hinder them from breaking out into vitious and enormous practices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>bonum civile,</hi> for civil good, that he may preſerve publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and keep up common honeſty and Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In <hi>bonum ſpirituale,</hi> for ſpiritual good, that he may defend the true Religion, that which is pure and undefiled before God and the Father, and keep up and encourage the Worſhip of God, which is warranted by
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42587:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Scripture. And all this is according to the word, which doth direct and command that we ſhould pray for Kings, and all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that under them we might lead peaceable and quiet lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty. So that the end of Government is the ſecuring peace and quietneſs, and the encouraging of honeſty and godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In all Government there is ſuppoſed a power ſufficient for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of things unto theſe ends, not only natural power, but alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority, lawfully come by, for without that there can be no juſt, right, and good Government. Magiſtrates therefore are called <hi>Powers. Rom.</hi> 13:1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers, for there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained by God.</hi> Lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are inveſted with Authority and Power; there are put into their hands the Scepter to rule, and the Sword to protect and puniſh as there is cauſe. They have a legiſlative Power, to make Laws, and iſſue out commands which ſhall oblige their Subjects; they have a right to do this, ſo they uſe their power rightly, and obedience is due from their People, obedience to all their juſt and lawful commands; they ought to rule in the fear of God, and their Subjects ought to obey in the fear of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:5. <hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject, and that not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake;</hi> as knowing that this is the will of God concerning you, and when any wilfully fail herein, they contract guilt, and break their own peace. And as there is an Authority to enact Laws, ſo a Power to ſuppreſs the Rebellions, and animadvert on thoſe that are refractorie and ſtubborn, and alſo to defend, reward and encourage all perſons ſtudious and careful of performing their duty. Where all this Power is not, there is a miſerable defect in the Government, which will in time dwindle and come to nothing, and confuſion and every evil work ſtep up in its place.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Government this Power is reduced into act; there is a prudent ſeaſonable exerting and putting forth of the Power in order to the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe ends. This is the complement of all, for it is folly for any to make that his end which is quite out of his reach; and that Power is in vain, which always lyes dorment. Power is not put into the Rulers hand meerly for ornament but for uſe. It is no other than a truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; therefore though he be a Magiſtrate over men, yet he is a Miniſter of God, and is obliged to ſerve his great Lord according to the beſt of his skill, and to act toward the end formerly mentioned. As he is advanced to high and honourable places, ſo he is engaged to great and excellent work. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13:4. <hi>He is not to bear the Sword in vain;</hi> and it may be ſaid, He weareth not the Crown in vain, he holdeth not the Scepter in vain, not for nothing, not for a meer ſhew, an empty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry, but for a good end, for excellent and noble purpoſes. The Crown and Scepter are not ſo glorious as that for which he is advanced, the Sword committed to him muſt be drawn againſt the enemies of God, and truth and holineſs; he muſt be an Avenger to execute wrath, not upon the pious and peaceable (that would be an abuſe of his Power)
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42587:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> but upon them that do evil. Thus have I ſhewed you what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is. Viz, Uſing of lawful Power for excellent ends.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing propounded was to prove and evidence to you that God doth Govern the world. As he made it at firſt, ſo he doth ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and order it. In a Nation you know there are many inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and under-Officers, yet it followeth not but the King is ſupreme, who authorizeth, influences, directs and limits them by his Laws. There are upon Earth many Governours, various forms of Government, yea the Angels in Heaven are miniſtring Spirits, employed in ſpecial and weighty matters. But all of them are ſet up and ſet forth by God, and fulfil his pleaſure. God himſelf ſits at the helm, and ſteers the courſe, he overrules and orders all from the higheſt to the loweſt. For the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceing hereof take theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, the light of nature hath diſcovered this, and by the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering thereof (though it burn dimly as a Candle in the Socket) many among the Heathens have been led to the knowledg of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to acknowledg it. It muſt be granted that they groped, and were exceedingly in the dark, differing much one from another in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents about the Deitie and his Providence. Some plainly denyed a God; ſome owned and aſſerted the being of a God, but denyed the creating of the World, but that it was from everlaſting, or roſe up through a fortuitous concurſe of atomes. Some granted that the World was of God, as of the firſt cauſe, yet he did not ſee nor obſerve what is done in it among men. Some held he doth indeed ſee all things that are and be done in the world, but he is only an inſignificant idle Spectator, who minds and regards nothing. Some were of opinion, that God doth not attend to the meaner and inferiour Creatures, nor take any cognizance of ſmall inconſiderable matters, but only ſuperintended the affairs and concernments of mankind. Doth God take care of Oxen? Some did again aſſert, that God did look after and care for all things, yet he acted only in a way of common general influences, and by ſecond cauſes, doing nothing immediately and by himſelf. Others again on the contrary ſide did affirm, that God doth immediately and by himſelf ſo work all in all, as that they left almoſt no place for ſecond Cauſes. Thus, poor Creatures were they divided among themſelves, having their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings miſerably darkened. But many among the Heathens, yea their moſt learned men, and of their moſt famous Sects, Platoniſts, Stoickes, Pythagoreans, did own the Divine Providence and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo did the Poets alſo; and for particular Perſons, the learned <hi>Plato, Seneca, Tully,</hi> (with many others) ſubſcribe thereunto. Hence it is that they call God the Rector and keeper of the world; the Soul and Spirit of the world, and do expreſly compare him to the Soul in the Body, and to the Maſter in a Ship, who doth command, rule, direct, ſteer and turn it what way and to what port he himſelf thinks good. But ſo much may ſuffice for that, I paſs on.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the Sacred Scriptures do abound w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th teſtimonies, which may afford us full ſatisfaction in the point. When he was about to puniſh
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42587:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> the world for the wickedneſs of them that dwelt therein, and to ſweep away the inhabitants of it with a Flood, he took care that all mankind ſhould not be deſtroyed, But <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were preſerved, yea and ſome of all the general ſpecies of animals too, that ſo Seed might be continued upon Earth, and that in the ordinary way of Generation; which was a famous and eminent inſtance of Divine Providence, and its orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Governing the World. Beſides that attend to theſe paſſages of Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 5:9. <hi>God doth great things and unſearchable, marvellous things without number. He giveth rain, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd water, ſets upon high thoſe that be low, diſappoints the devices of the craftie, taking them in their own craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and carrying the counſel of the froward head-long:</hi> Iſa. 45. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, I form the light, and create darkneſs, I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all theſe things,</hi> Pſal. 34: 16, 17. <hi>The face of the Lord is againſt them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the Earth; The Righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their diſtreſſes:</hi> Epheſ. 1:11. <hi>He worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will.</hi> Not onely ſome things, thoſe which are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous and ſtupendious, ſuch as ſtrike men with wonder and amazement, but all things, all is of God, and all not according to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of others, but according to his own eternal Counſel, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4:34, 35. <hi>His Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, and his Kingdom is from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation, and all the Inhabitants of the Earth are accounted as nothing, and he doth according to his will in the Armies of Heaven, and all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth, who are counted as nothing, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doeſt thou.</hi> Mat. 10:29. <hi>Are not two Sparrows ſold for a Farthing, and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Heavenly Father.</hi> Scriptures to this purpoſe might be multiplied, I will add but one more, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 103:19. <hi>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in Heaven, and his Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> But further conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, God hath a moſt unqueſtionable right to order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the world; it doth properly appertain unto him. The belief and acknowledgement hereof doth neceſſarily follow upon the owning of a God, to own ſuch a being as God, and yet to deny or queſtion his right to Govern is a groſs abſurditie.</p>
            <p>That being which we call God is the firſt, higheſt, nobleſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the moſt excellent <hi>Being</hi> of all, infinite and unchangeable in all perfections, and therefore he hath a right to order others that are not ſo. Man is endued with reaſon and underſtanding, and ſo is the moſt noble and excellent creature in this lower world, therefore it pleaſed his great Creator to put the Lordſhip into his hand, and to give him Dominion over the Fiſh and Fowl, and every living thing that moveth upon the Earth; the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>He hath put all things under his feet.</hi> How much more then is an abſolute and univerſal Rule due to God, whoſe underſtanding is infinite, and in whom are all the inexhauſtible, unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomtable treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg. Beſides that, conſider God as the Fountain of Being, the firſt cauſe and original of all Being. The world and all things in it are the works of his Hands. He made
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42587:168" rendition="simple:additions"/> them and faſhioned them, and ſeeing He made all, ſeeing by his power and for his pleaſure all things are and were created; it is highly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that all things ſhould be ordered, directed, and diſpoſed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure. Hath the Potter power over the clay, ſo as to make of it a Veſſel of honour or diſhonour, and hath not God much more power over his Creatures? If a Father hath an undoubted right to rule his own Children, and a Maſter to order his own Family; it cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be queſtioned, but God hath a right to rule all the Perſons and Creatures in the world, for <hi>we are all his off-ſpring, and of him the whole Family both in Heaven and Earth is named,</hi> of him it was made, and by him it doth conſiſt. Who can be ſo impudent and brutiſh, ſo much ſunk below man, and run ſo croſs to the principles and dictates of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to deny him a right to give Laws to them unto whom he gave life. It is highly decorous, every way fit, that he, from whom all things had their being, and unto whoſe power and goodneſs they own their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, ſhould appoint them all their ends, and direct their ſteps, and caſt their lines, and cut out their works, and overrule all their actions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For God to Govern the world is no diſhonour to him; it doth not unhandſomely reflect upon his divine Majeſty, nor cauſe the leaſt Eclipſe or diminution of his moſt excellent Glory. It is true, as I before hinted unto you, though ſome men cheerfully acknowledged a Governing and overruling Providence over humane actions and affairs, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it extended not its ſelf to more vile and contemptible creatures, or to minute and inconſiderable things. <hi>Jerom,</hi> though a learned and holy man, ſeemed to be of this opinion: for he grants a general order and diſpoſal, how ſuch an innumerable multitude of Fiſhes ſhould breed and live in the Sea, and how brutes and creeping things ſhould gender upon the Earth, and with what they ſhould be maintained, but he fancieth it a ſoleciſme to debaſe and bring down the Majeſty of the ever bleſſed God ſo low, as to mind and order the breeding and death of gnats, or to concern himſelf about the number of flyes and fleas that are upon the Earth, or how many Fiſhes ſwim in the Sea and Rivers, or which among the ſmaller ones ſhould become a prey to the greater, for they did fancy this to be altogether unworthy and unbecoming of God; judging of him by earthly Potentates, who take State upon them, and trouble not themſelves with any but the more weighty and momentous affairs of their Dominions, and leave things of ſmaller importance to their inferiour Officers.</p>
            <p>But this is not the manner of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor doth he count his care of the meaneſt and moſt minute beings, to be any reflexion upon him, unleſs it be of honour and glory. Therefore he expreſly tells us in his Word, that <hi>the young Lyons ſeek their meat of God; that he giveth to the Beaſts their food, and to the young Ravens when they cry. He cloathes the Lillies, and Sparrows are not forgotten by him, not one of them falls to the ground without him; the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry hairs of our head are numbered, he knoweth our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, counteth our ſteps, and puts our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar, into his Bottle.</hi> And what
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42587:168" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſhonour can all or any of this be to him? is it poſſible, that his doing ſo ſhould render him cheap to the children of men? nay, it is not enough to commend him to all wiſe and thinking perſons, that he is ſo great a God, as that he can extend his care to ſo many millions of Objects, and ſo graciouſly condeſcending, as to look after the loweſt of the works of his hands.</p>
            <p>Surely ſince i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was not unworthy of his divine Power to make the meaneſt Creature, it cannot be unworthy of his goodneſs to maintain and order it. If his eternal Power and Godhead are clearly ſeen in the things that are made, then his goodneſs doth likewiſe diſplay it ſelf in providing for them, and his wiſdom in Governing and directing them. It is true, he humbles himſelf when he beholds thoſe things which are above, much more when he regards thoſe that are here below, but that humbling of himſelf is glorifying of himſelf, and it doth deſervedly commend and endeare him to his People, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36:6, 7. <hi>O Lord, thou preſerveſt man and beaſt, how excellent is thy loving kindneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Our God is abundant in mercy and goodneſs; He is the Father of mercies, and a God of compaſſions, and as that doth render him fit to Govern the world, ſo it may work in us an aſſurance that he doth and will do it. Shall we fancy him like unto the Oſtrick, concerning which it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 39:14. <hi>That ſhe leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warmeth them in the duſt, and forgetteth that the foot may cruſh them, or that the wild beaſts may break them; ſhe is hardned againſt her young ones, as if they were not hers.</hi> Thus to do is utterly inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs: to fancie ſuch a thing of God would be to blaſpheme him; He hath a love and kindneſs for the works of his hands, as ſuch, and that will carry him out to a caring for them, and ordering of them. The world will love its own, and doth not God much more? A good Prince, who is the Father of his Country, and deſerves that name, will to the beſt of his skill guide and rule his Kingdom, at the helm whereof Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath placed him, that his own honour, and his peoples welfare might be ſecured and promoted. That man deſerves not the place nor name of a Maſter, who neglects to make proviſion for his own Family, and keep up order in it. That is an unnatural Father, unworthy indeed to be called <hi>man,</hi> who doth not according to his beſt knowledg and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, mind his children and Govern them.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>tampius nemo, tam Pater nemo;</hi> none is ſo good as God, none ſuch a Father as God, no love comparable to his love. All that love which may be found in the Creatures is but a drop from his Ocean, a ſpark from his flame; and as I have ſaid, all the world is his own, and all that is therein the works of his hands: He built this huge and ſtately Fabrick, and he furniſhed it with all its Inhabitants, from the higheſt and moſt glorious Angel to the meaneſt and moſt contemptible Inſect; and how can we poſſibly think otherwiſe, but that the pitty and love which he hath for the works of his own hands, will draw out his wiſdom, and power and care for the ruling and directing of them. For any one to deny this care, nay to heſitate about it,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42587:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> would be an unworthy baſe diſparagement, diſhonour, and affront to him.</p>
            <p>The third thing we have to do is to ſhew how our belief of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world may ſupport us in all worldly diſtractions, this is a great queſtion, very ſeaſonable, and of ſingular uſe, and that we may draw out the ſweetneſs of this truth, and fetch comfort from it, we muſt conſider theſe following particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. Gods accompliſhment for the work.</item>
                  <item>2. The extent of his Government.</item>
                  <item>3. The properties thereof.</item>
                  <item>4. Several things relating to the Church and its living Members.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, God is moſt fit and accompliſhed for this great work. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a buſineſs too hard for a Creatures hand to diſpatch, and a burden too heavy for a created ſhoulder to bear up under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome ambitious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been, and are ſaid to be aſpiring afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an Univerſal Monarchy, which they never did, nor never ſhall attain, it is bigger than their graſpe, a thing too high and too hard for them. And indeed thoſe Princes which rule well, and mind their work and duty, find the Crowns which they have, are lined with cares enough to make their heads ake, and their hearts too ſometimes. But to Govern the world is a thing utterly impoſſible to a created Being, not only to the wiſeſt man on Earth, but alſo to the higheſt Angel in Heaven. None can Govern the whole world, but He that did create it. Creation is peculiar to God, the greateſt Angel cannot create the ſmalleſt ſpire of graſs, nor a contemptible flea, no, not the leaſt atome. The moſt minute drop of being can proceed only from him, who is the Original and Fountain of all Being. So the Government of the whole world is peculiar to God, becauſe there is ſo much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in it, ſo many antipathies, things lye ſo croſs, men have unruly paſſions, they interfere in their ſeveral intereſt, and while they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of them on, quarrel and joſſle one another, and who but God can order all, and direct them to moſt noble and excellent ends, who but God can take theſe ſeveral ſcattered ſherds and unite them together in one curious and amiable piece of workmanſhip, who but God can take theſe jarring diſcords and turn them into an admirable and delightful harmonie. That God is perfectly accompliſhed for the work, ſo that he can not only do it, but the doing thereof will be no pain nor trouble to him, may thus appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is an immenſe Being; <hi>Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth his footſtool.</hi> Thoſe that have many Irons in the fire, buſineſs ſcattered up and down, muſt needs ſuffer ſome of thoſe Irons to cool, ſome of that buſineſs to lye by neglected, becauſe they themſelves are confin'd and limited Creatures. Some things may be amiſs and out of order under the Government of the moſt prudent and pious Prince, becauſe he cannot be at once in all parts of his Dominions; but God is omnipreſent, filling Heaven and Earth. <hi>If thou goeſt up to Heaven he is there; if thou make thy Bed in Hell, behold! he is there; if thou dwelleſt in the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, there ſhall his Hand lead thee, and his right Hand ſhall guide thee.</hi> All
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42587:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> things are within his reach, whereſoever any thing is doing or to be done there God is; who is preſent in every place and with every perſon? He ſtands at our right hands, and ſo may well guide them, ſo to do will coſt him no travel nor trouble. In him we live and move and have our being; not at a diſtance from him, not out of him, but in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God can eaſily Govern the world, becauſe of his almighty Power, he is ſtronger than all, his Word is enough to accompliſh all his will. The wiſeſt of men are fooliſh creatures; and the ſtrongeſt are weak. Kingdoms and Nations have frequently proved ungovernable to potent Princes. Such breaches have been made as they could not heale; and ſuch tempeſts have riſen as they could not lay. Nay that man is not found in the world, who hath Power ſufficient to Govern himſelf. How often doth his will rebel againſt his reaſon. <hi>Video meliora proboque, deteriora ſequor;</hi> His judgement ſees and votes for that which is good, but his will choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth what is worſe, his ſenſual appetite longs for it, and that muſt be gratified whatever the coſt be. We ſometimes ſee that wiſe men, gracious and holy men cannot curb their own paſſions, but they take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and hurry them into great and uncomely extravagancies. But now God is of infinite Power, as he hath an arm long enough to reach, ſo ſtrong enough to rule all things. He binds the Sea with a girdle, and ſtayes its proud waves, ſaying, hither ſhall ye go and no further. He makes the wrath of man to praiſe him, though it be more boiſterous than the Sea, and the remainder thereof he ſhall reſtrain. <hi>Job</hi> hath ſundry paſſages to this purpoſe, worthy of our remark, <hi>Job.</hi> 26. take ſome of them thus. <hi>He hangeth the world upon nothing. He hath compaſſed the waters with bounds; He divideth the Sea with his Power, the Pillars of Heaven tremble and are aſtoniſhed at his reproof.</hi> And then he cloſeth thus in verſe 14. <hi>Lo, theſe are part of his ways, but how little a portion is heard of him, and the Thunder of his Power who can underſtand?</hi> The Power of his Thunder is great, which diſcovered the forreſt, and makes the hinds to calve, what then is the Thunder of his Power when God doth but whiſper a rebuke into the eare of a man, that maketh his beauty to conſume like a moth? what then can he do, nay what can he nor do when he thunders from Heaven? In ſhort, his Power is irreſiſtible, and his will in all things efficacious. He can maſter all difficulties, and conquer all enemies, and overcome all oppoſition; when he hath a mind to work, who ſhall let him? he askes no leave, he needs no help, he knows no impediment. Mountains in his way become plaines; his counſel ſhall ſtand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, God is fit to Govern the world upon the account of his wiſdom and knowledg. His eyes run too and fro through the Earth. He obſerves all the motions and wayes of men. He underſtands what hath been, is, and ſhall be. <hi>Hell is naked before him,</hi> how much more Earth. His eye is upon the conclave of Rome, the Cabals of Princes, and the cloſets of particular Perſons. Excellently doth <hi>David</hi> ſet forth the divine Omniſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>Thou knoweſt my down-ſitting, and my up-riſing, and underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off. Thou compaſſeſt my
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42587:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways, there is not a word in my tongue, but, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether, thou haſt, beſet me behind and before.</hi> He knows not only what is done by man, but alſo what is in man, all his goodneſs, and all his wickedneſs; all his contrivances, purpoſes and deſigns; <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> do you ask who, the anſwer is ready, Jehovah. He ſearcheth the heart, he tryeth and poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th the reins. Thoſe are dark places, far removed from the eyes of all the world; but Gods eyes are like a flame of fire, they carry their own light with them, and diſcover thoſe receſſes, run thorow all the Labyrinths of the heart, they looke into each nooke and corner of it, and ſee what lurks there, what is doing there. O! what manner of Perſons ſhould we be! with what diligence ſhould we keep our hearts ſince God obſerves them with ſo much exactneſs! Men may take a view of the practices of others, but God ſees their principles, and to what they do incline them. Yea, He knows how to order and command the heart; not only how to affright it with terrours, and to allure it with kindneſſes, and perſwade it with arguments, but likewiſe how to change and alter and mend it by his Power. He cannot only debilitate and enfeeble it when ſet upon evil, but alſo how confirm and fix and fortifie it, when carried out to that which is good. The hearts of Kings are in the hands of the Lord, and he turned them as the Rivers of Water.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, God is fit to Govern the world upon the ſcore of his long-ſuffering and forbearance. Thoſe that have the reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put into their hands, had need be Perſons of excellent and cool Spirits; for if they have a great deal of Power, and but a ſmall ſtock of patience, they will ſoon put all into a flame. That man who hath but a little Family to mannage, will in that meet with trials and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes enough; How much more he that is ſet over a Kingdom; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably more yet he that is to Govern the world? eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent State of the degenerate world, and how things have been ever ſince Sin made an entry into it. <hi>The whole world now lyeth in wickedneſs;</hi> there is not a man in it, but doth every day offer a thouſand affronts to God, and provokes him to his face. Angelical patience would ſoon tire and be ſpent, and turn into ſuch fury as would quickly reduce all into a <hi>Chaos.</hi> There is not an Angel in Heaven, but if there were a commiſſion given him, he would do immediate execution, and ſheath the Sword of vengeance in the bowels of malefactors. But now, to his glory be it ſpoken, God is infinite in patience, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſs. Though he be diſobeyed, abuſed, grieved, vexed, preſſed with the ſins of men even as a cart is preſſed that is laden with ſheaves, yet he ſpares and bears, and waites. How loath is he to ſtir up all his wrath, and to pour out the Vials thereof. He counts that his ſtrange work, when he goeth about it, his bowels do often yearne, and his repentings are kindled together. In the 11. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8.9. He ſeemed to ſtand with his hand ſtretched out, as one reſolved to give a conſuming
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42587:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> blow, but he laid aſide his Weapons of indignation, and in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his compaſſion cryed out, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Judah? how ſhall I make thee as Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nah, how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, I will not execute the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceneſs of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy</hi> Ephraim, <hi>for I am God and not man.</hi> Thus we ſee God is accompliſhed for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the world.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place let us enquire concerning the extent of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Providence, how far and unto what it reaches. And take this in general, The whole world, and whatſoever is contained within the compaſs of Heaven and Earth, are ordered by him as his Family, the Church is regarded and cared for by him as his endeared Spouſe, and all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Saints as his children. All men even the worſt and vileſt, with all their actions, and all Creatures, even the meaneſt are ordered by God, and directed to their appointed ends. But we will deſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The governing Providence of God extends it ſelf to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever have being, both animate and inanimate, the greateſt and the leaſt. He rules the Stars, the Influences of <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and the Bands of <hi>Orion</hi> are from him. He cauſeth the Sun to ſhine, ſets him dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and anual Journeys, and when he pleaſeth, ſtops him in his courſe, and turns him back, when he comes out of his Chamber as a Bridegroom or a Giant refreſhed with Wine. He makes ſmall the drops of Rain, and cauſeth them to fall upon one City and not upon another, he feeds the Fouls, and muſters Caterpillars, Locuſts, Flies as his Armies, Angels are his Servants, abſolutely at his beck, ready to execute his Will, and by him they are ſent forth to miniſter unto his Children, and to puniſh his Enemies. He hath enraged Devils in a Chain, and both confines them, and imploys them as he himſelf thinks good. He ſuffered one to be a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets. He permitted Satan to do much againſt Job, yet kept him from touching his Life. He caſt Devils out of the poſſeſſed, and gave them leave to enter into an Herd of ſwine. He governs men too, keeping <hi>Abimelech</hi> from violating <hi>Sarahs</hi> Chaſtity and <hi>Laban</hi> from touching <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Liberty or Goods, and <hi>Eſau</hi> from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to his Life, the meaneſt Creatures are the Objects of his Cure, and the nobleſt are overruled by his Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Governing Providence of God extends it ſelf to all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions, without him we can do nothing, as a ſpecial aſſiſtance is neceſſary to gratious Acts, ſo is a general concurſe to natural ones, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſupport we cannot ſtir a ſtep, nor ſtrike a ſtroke, nor ſpeak a word nor form a thought, <hi>God ſuſpends the Creatures Actions</hi> when he pleaſeth, thus he kept the Fire from burning the three Children, that were thrown into it, when put into its greateſt rage. He ſtopt the mouths of <hi>Lions,</hi> and kept them from preying upon <hi>Daniel,</hi> when hunger was feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And it was he that taught and commanded the rapacious <hi>Raven</hi> to forget it ſelf, that it might carry food to a Prophet. <hi>God orders and directes actions</hi> to ends never deſigned by the doer, yea he makes the moſt
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42587:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> vile and wicked actions ſubſervient to moſt excellent and moſt noble ends. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin iſſued in the glorifying of Gods name in a mixt way of Juſtice and Mercy. <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Cruelty made <hi>Iſrael</hi> multiply, ſo that the more they were depreſt, the more they flouriſhed, <hi>Romes</hi> perſecutions have been <hi>Sions</hi> Enlargements, and the bloud of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> the Seed of the Church <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethrens ſelling him was a ſtep to his preferment in the Court of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and a ſending him before to preſerve the uſe of his Father and of his Family. The crucifying of our dear Jeſus was the ſaving of Believers, and by his moſt pretious bloud, which the Jews and <hi>Romans</hi> moſt wickedly ſpilt, were all the Elect of God redeemed from Hell and everlaſting deſtruction. The King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to deſtroy and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t off Nations not a few, but God ſent him as an Executioner of his Juſtice to puniſh an hypocritical Nation, and the people of his wrath. Thus God doth not only uphold his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their Beings, and aſſiſt and ſtrengthen them in their Actions, but he doth alſo direct, order and overrule thoſe actions, ſo that their product and iſſue ſhall be admirable, wicked men have baſe and ſordid ends in the Commiſſion of Sin, but God hath holy ends in his permiſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, while they gratifie their Luſts, he fulfills his pleaſure, and while they act like Devils, He acts like God, <hi>i. e.</hi> like himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Governing and overruling Providence of God extends it ſelf to all iſſues and reſults of things, both good and evil; <hi>the lot is caſt into the Lap, but the Diſpoſal thereof is of the Lord.</hi> He is the Fountain of all the good and comforts which we enjoy, for which we are under everlaſting Obligations to praiſe his Name, and not to ſacrifice to our own Net, That the Houſe is built, we owe more to God than to the Workmen; and in the preſervation of the City God is more to be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and acknowledged than the Watchman. It is unqueſtionably mens duty to follow their Callings, and mind their buſineſs; and ſtudy good Husbandry, for the ſluggard ſhall be cloathed with rags, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal will be glad of husks; but if after all endeavour and care an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate comes in, it is more of Gods ſending than of Mans fetching. The Bleſſing of God makes rich, and not mans diligence without it, when you are ſick, it is your wiſdom and duty to ſend for the moſt able, skilful and faithful Phyſitians, and to follow the method, and uſe the means, which they preſcribe, but when your Diſtempers are removed, and your Health is reſtored, you are beholden more to God than to Men and means; for notwithſtanding them your Souls would dwell in ſilence, if the Lord himſelf were not your help. The Battle is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to the ſwift, nor doth promotion come from the Eaſt, or the Weſt, but the Lord pulleth down one, and ſetteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>So for evil things, we are too prone to reſt in ſecond Cauſes, and care not to look ſo high as God, but whether we take notice of him or no, there is no rod under which we ſmart, but Gods hand lays it on. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> tells us, 5. <hi>Job.</hi> 6. <hi>Affliction cometh not forth from the duſt, neither doth
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42587:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> i. e. they do not come by chance, though many things be contingences, yet all things have a cauſe, to us indeed they are caſual, but to God they are certain. He himſelf foreſaw and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed them. There is nothing of <hi>Fortune,</hi> but all is of <hi>Counſel. Is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? i. e.</hi> any penal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, any afflictive Evil. There is not ſickneſs nor pain thou groaneſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not a Loſs thou meeteſt with, not a Croſs that pinches thee, but thou maiſt write the Name of God upon it. <hi>He creates Darkneſs as well as Forms the Light.</hi> When things run croſs to mens deſires and Intereſt, and expectations, they grow teachy and froward, and quarrel at this and that, but let this ſilence them, and work them to an humble and patient ſubmiſſion, that all is of God. <hi>Iſrael</hi> rebelled againſt the Houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> thereupon <hi>Rehoboam</hi> armed <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> to bring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom again to him; ſtay, ſaid God, <hi>ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your Brethren, the Children of Iſrael, return every man to his houſe, for this thing is of me,</hi> all <hi>good</hi> is of God, that obligeth us to thankfulneſs, and grateful acknowledgments; all <hi>Evil</hi> is of God, and that ſhould teach us humbly, patiently and ſilently to ſubmit. <hi>I was dumb ſaid David, and opened not my mouth, becauſe, Lord, thou didſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third place we ſhall enquire after the <hi>Properties</hi> of Gods Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the manner how he orders and governs all things; take that in theſe few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God doth govern the World miſteriouſly, ſo the Text tells us, <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs are round about him,</hi> as there are myſteries in the word, ſo in the works of God. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things hard to be underſtood, many rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, which nonplus and puzzle men of the largeſt and moſt piercing Intellectuals, 23. <hi>Job.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot behold him, but he knoweth the way that I take.</hi> God knoweth our ways, and counteth our ſteps, but the wiſeſt of men do not know all Gods ways. His way is frequently in the Sea, and his Charriot in the Clouds, ſo that he is inviſible, not only in his eſſence, but alſo in the deſign and tendence of his operations, thoſe that behold him with an Eye of Faith, do not yet ſee him with an Eye of Underſtanding, ſo as to diſcern his way, and whether he is going. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>his judgments are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his ways paſt finding out.</hi> Some of them indeed are obvious, plain and eaſie, we may upon the firſt view give a ſatisfactory account of them, we may read righteouſneſs, equity, mercy, goodneſs, love in them, becauſe written in Capital Letters, and with ſuch beams of Light as he that runs may read them. But others of Gods ways are dark and obſcure, ſo that they are out of our reach, and above our ſight. He that goes about in them ſo trace Gad, may quickly loſe himſelf. They are like that <hi>hand-writing</hi> upon the Wall, which none of <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> wiſe men could read or give the interpretation of. There are <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> ſecrets of State and Government, which are not fit to be made common. But this may be our comfort, though God doth not now give any
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42587:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> account of his matters, nor is he obliged thereunto, yet he can give a very good and ſatisfactory account, and one day his people ſhall be led into the miſtery, and though many things which God doth they know not now, yet they ſhall know them afterward, and when they know, they ſhall approve, and admire, both the things and the reaſon, and the end, they ſhall then be perfectly reconciled to all Providences, and ſee that all were worthy of God, and that in all he acted <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as did highly become himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth govern the world wiſely; He did indeed threaten it as a dreadful judgment upon Judah and Jeruſalem, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3:4 <hi>that He would give children to be their Princes, and Babes ſhould rule over them;</hi> not meaning children in years, for <hi>Joſiah</hi> a child was one of the beſt of their Kings, but children in underſtanding; ſuch as had no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor skill, nor conduct, knew not how to hold the Reign, nor uſe the rod, nor direct the courſe. It is certainly fatal to the world, when a young, heady and fooliſh <hi>Phaeton</hi> is got into the chariot of the Sun. Whither will not fiery ſteads carry an Aſs and others with him, but into deſtruction? when an ignorant unskilful Pilot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts at helm, the paſſengers of the Ship will ſoon be brought to their laſt prayers. But God is wiſe in heart, yea infinite in wiſdom; All the treaſures of wiſdom are in him, and no wiſdom is to be found in Angels or men, but what came from him, and all that (were it united in one) would not be comparable to what is in him. <hi>The very fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things of which wiſdom conſiſts, and both are in God moſt eminently. Knowledg of the nature of things, and prudence to diſpoſe, and order them. God knows all things perfectly, and orders them all exactly; all things are naked and opened before him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt curiouſly and accurately mannaged by him. Men in place of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power do ſometimes miſtake and miſcarry, doing many things amiſs. <hi>David</hi> was ſo ingenuous as to acknowledg it, <hi>I have ſinned greatly in that I have done, I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> But in all things God acts very wiſely. He is not a man that he ſhould erre or repent; ever ſince the Creation all things have been done with that unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable exactneſs, that if the world were to begin again, and the affairs of it to be acted over again, there ſhould not be an alteration in a tittle. All hath been ſo well, that nothing can be mended. Thoſe dark and obſcure paſſages of Providence, at which good men are ſtartled, and by which all men are poſed, are moſt excellent and curious ſtroakes, and as ſo many well plac'd ſhades, which commend the work, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably ſet off the beauty of Providence. That is a great Scripture, moſt worthy of our very particular notices, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1:11. <hi>He worketh all things according to the counſel of his will;</hi> which words plainly ſpeak theſe two things 1. The independency of God in his operations. He asketh not leave of any, neither Men nor Angels; He is not beholden to them, he doth not adviſe with them, he cannot be forced nor hindered

            <p>It is ſaid of God <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28:29. that <hi>he is wonderful in counſel and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in working;</hi> this latter neceſſarily follows upon the former. He muſt needs be excellent in working becauſe he is wonderful in counſel; All that he doth is the reſult of a moſt admirable judgment and mature counſel. The Holy Prophet therefore was raviſhed in his Spirit upon the conſideration of Gods work, both for their number and for their wiſdom; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104:24. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom haſt thou made them all.</hi> They are very many, yet all very good; notwithſtanding their multitude and variety. God miſcarried in none; there is an impreſs of wiſdom upon them all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God governs all things powerfully; where the word of a King is, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, there is power, what power then doth the Word of God carry along with it? He orders, and rules, turns and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns things as he thinks good. That is a notable and very comfortable place which we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33:11. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> The counſel of the Lord doth ſo ſtand, as that all things ſhall certainly fall before it that riſe up in oppoſition to it. The counſel of the Heathen, when contrary thereunto, is brought to nought, and the devices of the people are made of no effect. As the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> prevailed againſt the rods of the Magicians, ſo do the thoughts and counſels of God againſt all other thoughts and counſels that run counter and bid defiance to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135:6. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that he did, in the Heaven, and in the Earth, and in the Seas, and in all d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many men think, and ſome ſay, they will do what they will, eſpecially great men who are advanced in place, and armed with power, they love to be arbitrary, <hi>ſtat pro ratione voluntas,</hi> their will is their own reaſon, and ſhall be other mens Law; but to ſay, <hi>I will have my will,</hi> is a Speech too lofty for a Creature. When they exalt their wills God can bind their hands, and break their necks. How reſolved was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he would do this and that, I, that he would, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15:9. <hi>The enemy ſaid, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoile, my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them, I will draw my Sword, mine hand ſhall deſtroy them</hi> But God was full

               </gap>aſily ſcatter and conſume them, as if they had been but duſt or chaff; the breath of Gods noſtrils ſtopt the breath of their noſtrils. Nay God need not ſend forth a blaſt, when he did but give a look, the Hoſt of the Egyptians was troubled. When God hides his face from his people, he troubles them, and when he looks upon his enemies, he can trouble them.</p>
            <p>Nay more, God cannot only bind the hands of men, but he likewiſe can bind their wills, yea and turn their hearts too as the Rivers of water. He can make enemies to be at peace, and Lyons to lye down with Lambs, and Leopards with Kiddes, and Egyptians to lend their Jewels unto Iſraelites; yea he cannot only pacify them, but reconcile them, turning their enmity into friendſhip, and their hatred into love. <hi>Eſau</hi> reſolved to kill his Brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> but he embraced him, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him. Obſerve that paſſage, which plainly ſpeaks Gods power over the Spirits and wills of men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34:23, 24. Gods command there was this, <hi>thrice in the year ſhall all your men children appear before the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> And his promiſe was this, <hi>no man ſhall deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.</hi> The Jews were invironed with enemies, and thoſe enemies might very well deſire their Land, becauſe it was a good and pleaſant Land, flowing with milk and hony; and when all the males were gone up to Jeruſalem, and ſo the borders of the Country were left naked, that was a fit opportunity for an invaſion. But ſaith God, trouble not your ſelves, do your duty, go up when I bid you, and I will take care and overrule in the caſe; look you to your duty, and I will look to your borders; I will ſo order the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of your enemies, that not a man among them ſhall have any mind to give you a diſturbance, or to make an inroad into your Country. And this may afford ſtrong conſolation to us in the very worſt of times, and when things are darkeſt, that God, whom we own and ſerve, hath ſuch a mighty and effectual influence upon the hearts and wills of men, even of thoſe that are his peoples moſt deſperate and inraged enemies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God doth govern the world moſt righteouſly. So the Text tells us, <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> It is true, many times affairs are ſo mannaged, and things at ſuch a paſs good men depreſt ſo low, and wicked men advanced ſo high, vice encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and vertue frowned upon, godlineſs trampled under foot, and prophaneneſs rampant and triumphing; that thereby ſome have been induc'd to queſtion and deny a Providence, and even good men have been ſtumbled, as we may ſee in ſeveral precious and eminent Saints,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42587:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Joh, Jeremy, Habakkuk, Aſaph,</hi> whoſe names ſtand upon record in the Sacred Scripture. But it doth not become any of us to call the great and glorious God down to the bar of our reaſon, nor to meaſure his dealings with our line. It is not for us to be his Counſellors nor his Judges. Rather, where we cannot comprehend him, let us adore him, and give him the juſtification of faith, ſtill reſolving with <hi>Jeremy</hi> to hold faſt this concluſion, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord.</hi> And this is certain, whatſoever advantages ſome wicked men may have as to temporal, outward enjoyments, yet even here good men have the better of them, their lines are caſt in more pleaſant places, ſo that they have no cauſe of envy nor complaint.</p>
            <p>Have wicked men at any time the ſmiles of the world, the favour of great ones, waters of a cup full wrung out to them, do they ruffle in Silks, and gliſter with Jewels, and abound with ſenſitive comforts? The Saints, though they be poor and afflicted and deſpiſed, and counted the off-ſcouring of the world, have the love of Gods heart, which is moſt cordial, better than wine, and the graces of his Spirit, which do outworth the gold of <hi>Ophyr;</hi> and oftentimes the light of his countenance, and beams of his favour, which makes the moſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and comfortable day. They are arrayed with the robe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and garment of Salvation, which adorn them more than garments of wrought gold. Chriſt leads them into his Banquetting-Houſe, and there ſpreads over them the banner of his love, which affords the ſureſt protection, and the ſweeteſt ſhade. Who but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are able to tell or conceive what unſpeakable and glorious joy they have, what triumphs and exultings of Soul, when their beſt beloved Jeſus kiſſeth them with the kiſſes of his lips, and by his own Spirit witneſſeth with theirs that they are the Children of God, and with his moſt raviſhing conſolations doth delight their Souls! what are mines of gold, and rocks of Diamonds, what are Lordſhips and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, what are Crowns and Scepters, what Kingdoms and Empires to one drachme of grace, one ſmile from Heaven, one whiſper of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, one embrace of a Saviour? Curſed, ſaid noble <hi>Galeacius,</hi> be that man, who counteth all the world worth one hours communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and if one hour of Communion be ſo precious, what, O, what is a life of Communion?</p>
            <p>But then, ſtay till the winding up of the bottom, till that laſt and great day ſhall dawn, in which there will be a revelation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment of God, and of the marvellous goodneſs of God, wherein the wicked ſhall be ſtript of all their honour and power, of all their riches and pleaſures, and turned into Hell, for the wrath of God, and the worm of Conſcience eternally to feed upon them; And thoſe who have believingly cloſed with Chriſt, and bowed to his Scepter, and walked cloſely with God, and ſtudied the power of godlineſs and ſtrictneſs of Religion, ſhall enter into peace, and be cloathed with
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42587:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> glory, and ſit upon Thrones, poſſeſſed of a fulneſs of joy, and ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in Rivers of pleaſure, under the brighteſt and warmeſt beams of divine love, and in the moſt endearing embraces of the Lord Jeſus, and in the plenarie uninterrupted enjoyment of thoſe things, which eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard, nor have entred into the heart of man, without any diſquieting apprehenſions or fears of being ejected out of that poſſeſſion, or diſturbed in it. Then all the world, the moſt ſtupid and unteachable part of it will be throughly convinced, that there is a reward for the righteous, a God that Judgeth in the Earth, and that true godlineſs is profitable for all things, both for the life that now is, and for that which is to come, and that however things go now, yet it was not in vain to ſerve God. And therefore in the mean time, though Clouds and darkneſs are round about the Throne, yet let us rejoyce in the firm belief of what the Prophet tells us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145:17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt thing promiſed for the proof of the point, that Gods governing the world may well ſupport us in the midſt of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, is to preſent to your conſideration ſeveral things more particularly relating to the Church and People of this God. And they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nearneſs, dearneſs, and intimacy of that relation, in which the Church and Saints ſtand to God. What may not the wife and children of a loving and mighty King promiſe themſelves from his government? Certainly they may well be aſſured, ſo long as he keeps his Throne, and hath power in his hand, they ſhall want neither defence nor comfort. The Church is Gods Vineyard, and will he not water it, and keep it every moment, leſt any hurt it? She is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and will he not be tender over her, and kind to her? He is a Father to his people, and will he not look after them, and afford them maintenance and neceſſary ſupplies? He is more than a Mother to them, and will he not draw out his breaſts of conſolation, that they may ſuck and be ſatisfied, milk out and be delighted. Doubtleſs they may believingly expect all good from him, all kindneſs, all comforts from him, who hath been graciouſly pleaſed to put himſelf into all relations unto them. In the 23. <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 1. holy <hi>David</hi> looked with an eye of Faith but to one Relation in which God ſtood to him, <hi>the Lord is my Shepherd;</hi> and from thence he ſaw ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient encouragement to conclude that, <hi>he ſhould not want.</hi> What mayeſt thou then, O believer, argue from all Gods relations. He is my God, my King, my Maſter, my Father, my Husband; therefore ſurely I ſhall not want. He is a Sun and Shield, a Sun for comfort, and a Shield for ſecurity. In his beams then his children ſhall rejoyce, and in his ſhadow ſhall they ſit ſafely, and no good thing ſhall he with-hold from them that walk uprightly. Jeruſalem is the City of the great King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:42587:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> and if ſhe be Gods City, God will be her ſecurity. Never fear that, O Saints, for <hi>he is known,</hi> famouſly known <hi>in her Palaces for a refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſpecial intereſt which God hath in his Church and People, they are his <hi>Portion</hi> and <hi>Inheritance;</hi> And no one will, if he can help it, loſe his portion. <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth</hi> would not part with his Inheritance upon any termes, neither fell nor change it; much leſs will Chriſt with his, who is ſo greatly taken with it, as to count <hi>the lines fallen to him in a pleaſant place, and that he hath a goodly heritage.</hi> His people are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> and will he ſuffer them to be loſt? They are his <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and what! ſhall his enemies rob him of that? no, no, <hi>where his treaſure is, there his heart is alſo,</hi> and where his heart is, there ſhall his eye be watching, and his hand of power ſhall be ſtretched out, and his wings of protection ſhall be ſpread abroad, and <hi>Salvation it ſelf ſhall be for Walls and Bulwarks.</hi> The intereſt which God hath in all the world is not comparable to that intereſt which God hath in the Church. The reſt are but his Slaves, theſe are his Children; the reſt are but the rude wilderneſs, the Devils waſte, theſe are his Gardens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed. In others he ſees his power, but in theſe his Image and his Son. Others are the work of his hands, but theſe are the Workmanſhip of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That moſt endearing and entire affection which he beareth unto his Church and People. As be ſtands in all relations to them, ſo he hath all affections for them. You that underſtand what love is, do feel within your ſelves what a noble active, liberal principle it is, and what a mighty power and vigour there is in it. Now there is no love in the world comparable to the love of God. He hath a flame to our ſpark, an Ocean to our drop. The deareſt of Gods love is placed upon Chriſt, and in and for Chriſts ſake the ſame love is placed upon the Church and people of Chriſt; <hi>thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> And what will not ſuch love do? it will awaken care, and call forth power, and engage wiſdom, and open the Exchequer, and ſtick at no pains, no expence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43:4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee, therefore will I give men for that, and people for thy life.</hi> God loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the dwellings of <hi>Jacob</hi> more than all the Tents and Palaces of wickedneſs, and more than all the Thrones of iniquity that frame miſchief by a Law, for theſe ſhall have no fellowſhip with him. He loves one Saint more than he doth ten thouſand ungodly wretches, (with whom he is angry every day) and his poor Church more than all the world. Chriſt preferres his little flock before the hugeherds and droves which the Devil will have fall to his ſhare. And ſince this God, who is ſo much your Friend, gouerns the world, ſit down and think how much you may expect from him; nay, what good is there which you may not expect?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:42587:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. God hath eſpecially charged himſelf with his Church and People, as a good King looks upon it as his duty to ſtudy and promote the weal and comfort of all his Dominions, and all his Subjects, but in a more particular manner, the happineſs of his Conſort, and Children and favourites.</p>
            <p>There is, as I have ſhewn you, a general Providence of God, which extends it ſelf to the whole world, and for which all things fare the better; but beſides that there is a ſpecial Providence exerciſed about the Saints, of whom he is as tender as the apple of his eye. Next to his own intereſt that of his People lyes cloſeſt to his heart, and doth moſt engage his thoughts. Others are under his eye which runs to and fro through the Earth, but theſe are under his wing. <hi>Doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> yes, that he doth, and of Aſſes too, and of young Lyons, and Wolves and Bears and Tygers, and all the Beaſts of prey; but he takes another manner of care for his Lambs, and his Dove in the clefts of the Rock, and in the ſecret places of the ſtairs. You read, and rejoyce when you read, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4:10. <hi>That he is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi> They are his peculiar people, and ſo the objects of his peculiar care; whatſoever God doth he minds them: and whoever are neglected and left to ſhift for themſelves, to be ſure they ſhall not. What! <hi>Noah</hi> drowned in the waters of deluge, or <hi>Lot</hi> burnt with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> and the Cities of the plain. No, no, it could not poſſibly be; <hi>Noah</hi> muſt be ſecured in the Ark before the windows of Heaven were opened, and the Fountains of the great deep were broken up. And <hi>Lot</hi> muſt be arrived at <hi>Zoar</hi> the City of his refuge, before the ſtorm of Fire and Brimſtone could fall. <hi>Zion</hi> is engraven upon the palmes of Gods hand, and her Walls are continually before him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God hath already done great and marvellous things for his Church and People, not only being at charge upon them in the ordinary way of his common Providence, but likewiſe putting forth extraordinary and magnificent acts whenſoever their caſe did call for them. Miracles have been nothing to him at ſuch a time; he hath not only wrought one or two, but multiplied them; there hath been a ſeries of them, as if he counted them cheap. His arm hath awakened and put on ſtrength, and alſo put forth ſtrength. No leſs than ten wonderful plagues did he ſend upon that proud King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Iſraels cruel oppreſſor; and rather than he ſhould not have let them go, I queſtion not but he would have ſent a thouſand more. And if after they were gone, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would purſue them, God would make for <hi>Iſrael</hi> a way through the Sea, and for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his hoſt a grave in it. The courſe of nature was for a while ſtopt, and the Sun made to ſtand ſtill upon <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moon in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> that his People might avenge themſelves upon their enemies. Clouds have ſhowred down Manna upon them, and flinty Rocks, as hard and dry as they are, have powred out water. And though ſuch kind of works have not been performed in the latter
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42587:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> days, yet God in them hath not left himſelf without witneſs, neither is his arm ſhortned, nor hath he loſt his old wont; Miracles are as eaſie to him now as they were formerly, and if need were, he would do them. But beſides them conſider theſe three things which God hath done all along.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath in all times preſerved and kept up a Church in the world; though Chriſt hath but a little flock, and that is encompaſſed with rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Wolves, yet he hath always had a flock. When all fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their way, there was a Church in <hi>Noahs</hi> Family. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had generally perverted their way, and turned aſide to abominable idolatry, there were ſtill reſerved ſeven thouſand faithful worſhippers, that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> In the thickeſt darkneſs and moſt furious rage of Popery there were thoſe that owned and pleaded, and ſuffered for the truths of the Goſpel. The four mighty <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the world have been ſhaken down and broken into ſhivers, but the Kingdom of the <hi>Lord</hi> is an everlaſting Kingdom, and his Dominion is from generation to generation. The Church indeed hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike conſpicuous, nor hath it always been in the ſame ſtate of purity, peace and proſperity, but it hath always had a being. Chriſt was never without ſome militant Subjects, nor his truth without ſome faithful witneſſes, two at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath employed Angels for his Churches comfort and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, who knowing it to be the will and pleaſure of their great Creator, do moſt readily comply and cheerfully obey. As the gates of Hell ſet themſelves againſt it, ſo doth the Hoſt of Heaven engage for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1:14. <hi>They are all miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi> When the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> was in ſome danger from environing enemies, the Mountain was immediately garriſoned with Horſes and fiery Chariots, that came in to be his guard. They have it given them in expreſs charge to bear the Saints up in their hands, and to encamp round about them, and may not this be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort to believers? what, though they be the objects of Hells envy, and Earths malice, yet they are Gods darlings, and Angels charge! And whatſoever work Angels have to do for them, they not only diſpatch it faithfully, but delight to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath turned all things to the Churches advantage, ſo that it hath not been a loſer in the upſhot; from what corner ſoever the wind hath blown, it hath done Chriſts garden a real and ſenſible kindneſs, both the North and the South wind have made ſpices to flow forth. You know what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:28. <hi>All things work together for good to them who love God, that are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Comforts and croſſes too, mercies and judgments too; Sunſhine and ſtorms, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and afflictions, every thing, all things are employed, all buſie, all at work, and all at work for good. Take a wicked man, and all
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42587:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> things are againſt him; take a Child of God, and all things are for him; all are ſent upon a gracious excellent deſign, and ſhall proſper in it. More particularly, oppoſitions, perſecutions and fiery Tryals have iſſued in theſe three things, which are choice advantages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By theſe things God makes a diſcrimination, and ſeparates between the good and the bad the precious and the vile. In thoſe Fields where there is care taken to ſow the beſt and cleaneſt corn, the envious one will come and ſcatter eares. Churches do contract filth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as well as other bodies, and though they were very pure in their firſt erecting and conſtitution, yet afterward they do degenerate, and ill humours flow and abound in them. Some among them leave their firſt love, and their firſt works, and are drawn aſide from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel, and live not according to the rules of the Goſpel. Yea there are not only decaying Profeſſors, but alſo falſe hypocritical pretenders creep into Churches; Afflictions now are the <hi>Phyſick</hi> God gives for the purging them out; theſe are the <hi>Fan</hi> of Chriſt, with which he cleares his Floor: they are his <hi>Fire</hi> for the refining of his Gold, and ſevering it from the droſs. When ſtorms ariſe, the rotten and unſound fruit falls off. When perſecution ariſeth, ſtony ground hearers are offended: then away go formaliſts, hypocrites, and all ſuch as were ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs. And it is a good riddance, for God and his Church need them not. What loſs is it when greedy Wolves and filthy Swine in Sheeps cloathing forſake the fold? they never did good in it, and never will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By troubles and perſecutions the good are bettered; In ſuch times and by ſuch means their corruptions are mortified, and their graces are brightned. The trees of righteouſneſs, which are planted in Gods Courts, do root the faſter for being ſhaken with Tempeſts, and flouriſh the more for their pruning. Their fierce Tryals do refine their Souls, and heat them into a greater. zeal for God and holineſs. The very rage and malice of their enemies doth ſtrengthen their care, and raiſe their reſolution, ſo that they grow ſtronger and ſtronger. <hi>Michal</hi> jeer'd and ſtouted at <hi>David</hi> for this zeal, but he plainly and bravely told her, <hi>if that was to be vile, he would be yet more ſo.</hi> Upon theſe two accounts, when times are ſaddeſt, and perſecution hotteſt, whatever may be ſaid of the actings of men, there is no cauſe to complain of male adminiſtration on Gods part, ſo long as the Church is made purer, and the Saints are made better. But I will add this further.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By theſe perſecutions the Church is enlarged, and the number of her Children is encreaſed. The oppreſſing of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by hardned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> iſſued in their multiplying. When the Church at Jeruſalem was ſcattered, the Kingdom of Chriſt was amplified the more by it. Thoſe afflictions and bands which happened to <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:42587:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> tended to and ended in the furtherance of the Goſpel. The blood of the Martyrs hath all along been the Seed of the Church. Perſecutors are fools as well as mad men, they loſe what they do, Chriſt and the Goſpel gain. So doth God outſhoot his enemies in their own bow, and makes their very wrath to praiſe him. And let Tryals and Perſecutions come to never ſo great an height, I know no reaſon why the joy of Believers ſhould not be increaſed, when the Nation of Saints is multiplied. Do you, all you that profeſs Religion and godlineſs, look to it that the number of Chriſtians be not diminiſhed and leſſened through your wretched Apoſtacy, and then it ſhall be augmented through your firmeneſs and holy conſtancy. That is the fifth thing by which we may ſupport and comfort our ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> The great things which God hath done for his People.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There are very great and glorious things which God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do. If all were accompliſhed which God hath in his heart and purpoſe to do for his Church, none of us ſhould be here, the world would have an end, and time would be no more. The world doth upon ſome account owe its continuance to the Church. The world is but the ſtage upon which God is acting for his Name and for his Church, and when the Act is finiſhed, the ſtage ſhall be pull'd down. When wicked and ungodly men are plotting againſt the Church, and perſecuting of her Children, they act indeed like unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men, in digging up thoſe very foundations, on which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtand, and pulling down the Pillars that uphold them. And as God continues the world for the ſake of the Church, ſo he hath great of things yet in his purpoſe and promiſe, which muſt by no means fail for their accompliſhment. Such as theſe, the giving great peace to her Children, the bringing down her proud and inſulting enemies, eſpecially that grand and implacable one, <hi>Babylon.</hi> The bringing in both his ancient people the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The making the place of his feet glorious, and ſetting up the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his Houſe in the top of the Mountains, and cauſing the Kings of the Earth to bring their glory and the honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. God hath laid upon himſelf ſtrong obligations to do theſe and ſuch like things, and therefore we are on the ſurer hand. God hath bound himſelf by promiſe; and that is as good ſecurity as heart can deſire; Gods Word is better than mans bond, It is ſetled in Heaven, It is yea and amen. God can as ſoon ceaſe to be as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify his Word whatſoever thou haſt a promiſe for; O Believer, thou mayſt be as ſure off, as if thou hadſt the thing in thine own poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And how dark ſoever, and croſs ſoever Providence may ſeem to be, do not you fear them, for there always is a ſweet harmony and perfect agreement between Providences and promiſes, yea the great work and buſineſs of Providence is to give accompliſhment to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42587:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> the promiſes. Divine Providence is the Midwife of promiſe, and is to give Birth to thoſe bleſſed and admirable mercies which it travails with. And though ſometimes Providence acts ſomewhat roughly, yet it always proceeds very ſafely, ſo that there never is a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p n="8">8. God is greatly concerned in the good and welfare of his Church and People; He is more concerned than we are, and all the men in the world. It is very true, we are nearly concerned in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church and true Religion, in the Churches peace it is that we ſhall have peace. Our all is indeed imbarqued in this Ship, if that ſhould be caſt away, we are ruined; you may reckon upon that. Let Religion be loſt, and we are loſt, farewell proſperity and all that you can call good, and therefore none of us ſhould be careleſs, or wanting to Prayer or duty. But know, God is more concerned than we are. The Church is much concerned in the preſent motions and commotions, Antichriſt and his Jeſuits are fiſhing in theſe troubled waters, but let us be comforted, God is concerned in the Church, and that more than we all are. Who ſhould ſpeak his glory, and live his praiſe, and load his Altars, if the gates of Hell and endeavours of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould prevail againſt the Church? would Atheiſts, Papiſts, or profane Perſons exalt and advance his honour? As to this lower world, Gods ſtock of glory lyes in the hands of his Church and People, and his Revenue is brought in by them, and will He not look after them? let us not fear where no fear is; let us not fear in the midſt of fears. We may be confident that God will wiſely ſteer the courſe, and carry the Ship of the Church ſafe into its Harbour, in which he hath his Name and Honour imbarqued. He will never give his glory to another, nor his praiſe to graven Images; and if not to graven Images, then not to Papiſts. Suppoſe thoſe curſed Philiſtines ſhould take the Arke, yet know aſſuredly, the captivated Ark will be too hard for <hi>Dagon;</hi> graven Images and all Idolatry ſhall fall before it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Laſtly, let us comfort our ſelves with this, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is laid upon Chriſts ſhoulder, and the Scepter put into his hand, and all power both in Heaven and Earth is committed to him. God the Father hath ſet him up for his King upon his holy Hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> and hath ſo eſtabliſhed and fixed his Throne, that he looks with ſcorn and contempt upon all the attempts of his enemies. And all that power which He hath was committed to him, and is to be employed by him for the continuance and comfort of his Church. <hi>He is made Head over all things to the Church.</hi> Whatſoever He hath as Head, is for the advantage of that his myſtical body. And what may we not expect from ſuch a Father as God, from ſuch a King as Jeſus? And with what peace and delight may we ſit under his ſhadow! well might the holy Pſalmiſt ſay <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149:2. <hi>Let Iſrael rejoyce in him that made
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42587:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> him, let the Children of Zion be joyful in their King.</hi> From what Chriſt hath done, we may ſtrongly argue to that which He will do. He was incarnate for his Church, He was made under the Law for her, He became poor for her, He humbled himſelf for her, He laid down his Life for her, He bare the rage of man, and the wrath of God for her, He endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, becauſe it was for her, and therefore queſtion not but he will rule and govern her. Read and rejoyce while you read that account given of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9:7. <hi>Of the increaſe of his Government and peace there ſhall be no end, upon the Throne of David, and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment, and with Juſtice from henceforth even for ever.</hi> And that you may not in the leaſt doubt hereof, it is added, <hi>the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi> Having thus finiſhed the Doctrinal part, I come to the Application, and I ſhall only ſpeak to an uſe of Exhortation, in two particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I exhort and adviſe you that are the people of God, to fetch ſupport and conſolation from this ſweet and precious truth. The times in which we live are indeed very dark and tempeſtuous, God is ſhaking all Nations. Specially it is a day of perplexity and caſting down in the <hi>Valley of Viſion</hi> the Church of God; After all our Prayers and endeavours, and hopeful expectations things are come to a ſad paſs, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> is brought back to the Red Sea. We may now take up that complaint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26:17, 18. <hi>Like a Woman with Child that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cryeth out in her pangs, ſo have we been in thy ſight, O Lord. We have been with Child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind.</hi> The People of the moſt High in all places are in ſoar trouble, a cup of trembling full of the Wine of aſtoniſhment is put into their hands, and God carries as if he were reſolved to give up the dearly beloved of his Soul for a time into the hand of her enemies. The Antichriſtian Popiſh party is rampant, and think they have the Ball at their foot, and ſhall now carry all before them. But at ſuch a time as this, let this ſupport, and quiet and comfort you, that however things go, God ſtill governs the world. And that this may be ſweet to you follow theſe directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make ſure that you be in the number of Chriſts Subjects; ſuch as have bowed to his Scepter, ſubmitted to his Government, and are devoted to his fear. If you have once kiſſed the Son with a kiſs of love and homage, you ſhall not periſh in the way; Then you may rejoyce at the thoughts of Gods governing the world, when you feel and are aſſured of his ruling and governing in your hearts. Then may the remembrance and conſideration of his univerſal Kingdom be cordial to you, when you find that he hath erected a Kingdom within you, and that you are members of the Kingdom of his Grace. This is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42587:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> firm gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd of ſtrong conſolation, and of qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>e and aſſurance for ever. If you have been made willing in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of Gods power, and are the Loyal Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> you are the favourites of Gods Court, yea the Children of his Family, and you may promiſe yourſelves that he will carefully look after you, and graciouſly provide for you. He hath a peculiar reſpect to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, for them he hath his Chambers, a ſtrong Tower, in which they ſhall be ſafe, when he cometh out of his place to puniſh the Inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity. Judgment begins at the Houſe of God, and that is to make way for mercy, thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prepare for deliverances here and glory hereafter, for victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries here, and triumps hereafter. But O! the dreadful ſtormes of wrath that ſhall fall upon the wicked and incorrigible of the world, what Thunder-bolts will God aſſail them with, that ſhall ſtrike them down into that lake which burns with Fire and Brimſtone, and ſhall never be quenched. Come Chriſtians, make it out that you truſt in the Lord, and have given up your ſelves unto the Lord, and then you may be ſure that when enemies threaten you, and dangers face you, and fear is on every ſide, even then mercy ſhall compaſs you about.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heedfully look to it, that you govern your ſelves according to the will and Law of God. Then may you take the comfort of Gods governing the world when you are a well governed People. When you wiſely rule your own Spirits, and order your own affections, and your lives and converſations, there is a promiſe, that <hi>unto ſuch God will ſhew his Salvation.</hi> The Laws of a Land protect the Subjects ſo long as they keep them. A tranſgreſſion of the Law is the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Subject; <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge ever thee to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ep thee in all thy ways.</hi> Their commiſſion, as large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is, reaches no further; when you leave that, you loſe your guard; but while you keep your way, Angels, yea the God of Angels will keep you. Do not ſo much fear looſing your Eſtate, or your liberty or your lives, as loſing your way, and leaving your way, fear that more than any thing; nothing but Sin expoſeth you to miſery. So long as you keep your way, you ſhall keep other things, or if you loſe any of them you ſhall get that which is better; though you may be ſufferers for Chriſt, you ſhall not be loſers by him. <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man, and perfect in his generation, and walked with God, and he was ſecured in the Ark before the world, was drowned with the Flood. Let the worſt come that can, it is not ſo bad as carnal reaſon repreſents it; if a good man ſhould be deprived of his temporal comforts, it will commend ſpiritual ones the more to him, ſo that he ſhall the better relliſh and taſte them. Gods voice is never ſo ſweet, as when he ſpeaks comfortably in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. If a Child of God ſhould be cut off by a violent ſtroak, he is thereby brought the ſooner to his Father, ſuch a death is the ſhorteſt way home. If inraged Perſecutors add to his ſufferings, in
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42587:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo doing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y add to his Crown; and by making his burden heavy, they make his glory the more exceeding weighty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let Gods governing the World be the matter of your Faith: no Truth will be a Staff of Support, unleſs you carry it in a believing hand, precepts will not prevail, threatnings will not awe you, and promiſes will not comfort you, and the moſt pretious Scripture-Revelations will not chear you any farther than as they are believed. Let a Miniſter of the Goſpel preſent you with never ſo precious a Cordial, made up of the moſt choice and excellent Ingredients, it will do you no good unleſs it be mingled by you with Faith; therefore believe that the management and ordering of all things is in the hand of God, and pray that you may have a well confirmed and improved Faith hereof, when the Faith is weak, it affords but weak comfort, do you ſtrengthen your Faith, and that will greaten your peace, and raiſe your joy, to this end.</p>
            <p>Be careful of this, that you do nothing to the prejudice of your Faith, do not you weaken that which muſt ſupport you; what a madneſs was it for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to let his Locks be cut, when he knew he ſhould loſe his ſtrength together with them. Now, there is nothing in the World ſo prejudicial to Faith as Sin is. A guilty Conſcience doth always make a palſey-hand, which is tremulous and ſhaking, whenſoever it goes about to lay hold upon God and Chriſt and the Covenant or any promiſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Conſcience are ſevere checks to Faith. O! ſaith the poor ſoul, when ſnib'd from within: What! ſhall I look upon God as my God? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs, I have diſobeyed and diſhonoured him. Shall I truſt in Chriſt as my Saviour? I have crucified him afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. Shall I rejoyce in the Covenant? I have broken it, and dealt falſely in it. Shall I delight in the promiſe, and live upon it? where is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I cannot find it in my ſelf. Such Reflexions as theſe produce inward Troubles and Diſquiets and Fears, ſo that the very ſweet meats of the Goſpel are imbittered to ſuch an one. He cannot relliſh them, becauſe he queſtions his Intereſt in them. What is <hi>all God,</hi> to one that cannot ſay, <hi>my God?</hi> Guilt makes Faith and Comfort run low; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>Great Peace</hi> have they that love the Law, and nothing ſhall offend them: they have peace in trouble, joy in ſorrow, calms in ſtorms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſedateneſs in the midſt of outward Commotions, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we boldneſs toward God,</hi> and if ſo, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort comes in from every Proſpect, which we have of God. Let us then Look upon him which way we will, we ſhall ſee ſmiles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that very appearance, which is dark to others, will give Light to us.</p>
            <pb n="414" facs="tcp:42587:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Be very ſerious and frequent in your Meditations upon Gods Governing the World, tranſient and fleeting thoughts make either none, or but little and ſlight and ſhort Impreſſions. The Burning-Glaſs will not Fire any combuſtible matter, unleſs it be held ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time with a ſteady hand in the beams of the Sun, ſo it is here, dwell therefore in your thoughts upon this Subject, conſider it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to conſider, repeat the Work again and again, and again. 25. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Mine Eyes are ever toward the Lord,</hi> that is, often and often, at all times, and upon all occaſions, Was he in ſtraits, he looked to God? Was he in danger, he looked to God? Was he in fears, he ſtill looked to God? and that ſupported him, as you may gather from the next Words. <hi>He ſhall pluck my Feet out of the Net,</hi> though mine Enemies have got me in their Net, and I am ſo entangled in it, that I cannot make my own Eſcape, yet God ſhall pluck me out, from him I ſhall have my Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and a Song. And in ſuch Caſes and Conditions we ſhould ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look to God, under the notion of Supreme Rector and Governour of the World. Are there confuſions and diſtreſſes up and down in the World? Are Foundations out of courſe, yet comfort your ſelves with this, that God ſits at the helm, and he is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in time of trouble, you will find ſerious reiterated medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be exceeding influential upon you. <hi>David</hi> remembred God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Bed, and meditated upon him in the night-watches, and called to mind his former mercies, how he had been his help, 63. <hi>Pſalm</hi> and this greatly ſupported and comforted him; <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>in the ſhadow of thy wings will I rejoyce,</hi> he would both hide under it and rejoyce, Gods ſhadow ſhould be both his ſhelter and his Paradiſe, and ſo it may well be, for his Name is not only a ſtrong Tower, but likewiſe an Ointment pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth, having in it ſtrength and ſweetneſs.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Uſe I exhort and beſeech you to evidence it unto the World, That your Belief of Gods Governing the World doth really ſupport and chear you in the midſt of the preſent Diſtractions, when many Mens hearts are failing for fear of thoſe things, which may come to paſs. The Truth is, the day in which Providence hath caſt us is a day of Diſtraction; the World is ſtark mad: wicked men are mad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſin and vanity, and ſuperſtition and idolatry, and mad againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſs. Well, Chriſtians, if they will be mad, let them be ſo, God knows how to tame them, and how to chain and fetter them too, he hath hooks for their Noſes, and bridles for their Jaws. Only, be you ſober, and in <hi>patience</hi> poſſeſs your ſouls. Oh that, when it may be ſaid, here is the curſed, helliſh rage, and Bedlam, frantick Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Atheiſts and Papiſts, it may alſo be ſaid, <hi>here is the Faith, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="415" facs="tcp:42587:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>When there are thoſe that make it their deſign and buſineſs to deſtroy and confound all things, do you rejoyce in this, That God Governs all wiſely, powerfully, graciouſly, ſo that thoſe things which have the moſt frightful aſpect, the moſt amazing paſſages which we hear of, or meet with, are the Products of an Eternal Counſel, and ſhall at laſt (it may be ere long) iſſue in an happy cloſe, however affairs go now, God hath bid us, <hi>ſay to the Righteous, it ſhall be well with him.</hi> Do you evidence the powerful and comfortable influence that Gods Government hath upon your Spirits, by theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt by the k eping up your ſpirits, yet have need of Patience, ye may find a little will not ſerve your turn, lay up therefore good ſtore of it, and then fetch out of that ſtore, and let patience have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work, but withal caſt not away your confidence, for it hath great recompence of reward. <hi>We will not fear,</hi> ſuch the Church, <hi>though the Earth be removed, and the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea,</hi> let the wicked fear where no fear is, but let the Saints be fearleſs in the midſt of fears. <hi>Why are ye fearful,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples, when the Ship was almoſt covered with Waves. He ſets men above God in his thoughts, whoſe fear of man prevails againſt his faith in God, that man either is altogether forgetful of God, or his thoughts of him are low and unbecoming, for certain he doth not ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſt in his heart, let your faith be preſerved in vigour and exerciſe: What though the Beaſt have ſeven Heads and ten Horns, great ſubtilty, and no leſs power, yet the Lamb ſhall overcome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Evidence it by your perſeverance in Godlineſs, hold on your way, make not uſe of any ſinful means, neglect not any part of your duty to ſecure your ſelves and avoid danger; do not offend God, be not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Devil for your liberty and peace, what though there be Lions in the way, go on, and proceed boldly, ſo long as it is the way of God, you may live by faith, while you walk by rule, you may walk believingly and cheerfully while you walk regularly, the wound that a man gets by ſin, will put him to far greater ſmart and pain, that all his ſufferings for God and godlineſs would have done. He than purchaſes the favour of men with the frowns of Conſcience, will find he hath made a very hard bargain, every ſtep from God is a ſtep to ruin, if any man draw back, Gods ſoul will have no pleaſure in him, whereas he that walks uprightly walketh ſafely.</p>

            <p n="1">I. What the <hi>Memory</hi> is, it is that Faculty of the Soul, wherein are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the things we know. Though it belong to the Senſitive Soul, and ſo is in ſome Meaſure common to Brutes with Men, yet I ſhall handle as it is ſeated in the rational Soul, where it is the Storehouſe not only of whatſoever is brought in by the Eye and Ear, which are the two Senſes of Diſcipline, but alſo of what is imparted by the underſtanding. For the Memory is neerly allyed to the Underſtanding, if it be not the ſame as many think. Its Office however is 1. to <hi>Receive</hi> ſuch things as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, wherein it is fitly enough compared to <hi>ſoft Wax,</hi> which is prepared to receive any Impreſſion made upon it. 2. To <hi>Retain</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42587:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> what is laid up therein; wherefore it is oft call'd by the <hi>Antients, Venter animae,</hi> the belly of the Soul.<note place="margin">Aug. to. 10. p. 509.</note> There is a little Kingdom in the Soul of Man. The King or rather Vice-Roy is the Will, the Privy Counſel is the Underſtanding, the Judge is the Conſcience, and the Great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer is the Memory. 3. To <hi>Recall</hi> or recover what was out of mind.<note place="margin">Quorum certè recordamur eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; quicum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitùs obliti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, eorum obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio, quorum partim memini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, partim ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liti ſumus, eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt reminiſ. centia, <hi>Zanch. tom. 3. l. 2. c. 5.</hi>
               </note> And this is proper to Mankind and is not in Brutes: For it proceeds from the motion of the Images of things in the brain by the activity of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which conſidering the time, place, perſons, and ſuch like circumſtances of things, by degrees recovers what was out of the way; for as things themſelves, ſo the phantaſms of things are connexed together, and by one we recover another. And this intellectual memory is inſeparable from the rational Soul; in that the Soul undoubtedly remembers, when it is quite ſeparate from the body. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. But <hi>Abraham ſaid</hi> (to the Rich man in torments) <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things.</hi>

               </note> It hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make things that are in themſelves abſent and paſt, to be preſent. By the help of Memory, we retain what we have read in Books, and what we have heard in Sermons or other Diſcourſe, the Examples of Gods Mercies and Judgments for our Incouragement and Warning: All theſe and ten thouſand things more are laid up in the Memory, which is the Souls Treaſury, ſo that the Soul would be a poor Soul without the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, we may ſee the worth of this Faculty by thoſe that are depriv'd of the uſe of it, that can remember no body, nor the laſt queſtion that they did ask. Thus we read of <hi>Meſſala Corvinus</hi> an Orator that forgat even his own Name; and of <hi>Atticus</hi> the Son of <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Sophiſt,</hi> that could never remember the Names of the Letters of the Alphabet, till his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was fain to name four and twenty Boys by the Names of the ſeveral Letters, that he might retain them. All a mans paſt life would be loſt if his Memory were loſt, ſo are the comforts of the Soul loſt, ſo far as they are forgotten. So that the Soul would be poor in Knowledge, poor in gifts, poor in comfort without the Memory. Eſpecially this Faculty was happy in its primitive State, for then its <hi>Reception</hi> was eaſy, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> firm, the Recovery (if any uſe of it) ready, then 'twas like a clear Chryſtal Glaſs, wherein all that was contained in it, was eaſy ſeen, now it is crackt and muddy; then 'twas like an iron Cheſt, now like a Bag with Holes. It had the Neighbourhood of a clear Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of an holy Will, and <hi>Adam</hi> could not but <hi>remember his Creator in thoſe Days of his Youth.</hi>

               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:42587:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>III. The <hi>Corruption</hi> or Depravation of this Faculty: For by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> each Faculty of the Soul was woefully deprav'd, when a curious Watch falls to the ground, though it be ſorely maimed, yet ſome wheel or pin may have received no hurt; but here it is otherwiſe. Our Fall was like that of ſome rare Glaſs, which thereby is ſhatter'd all to pieces; there remains all the Materials of it, ſo doth Reaſon and Memory with the Soul, but they muſt be melted and caſt a new before they be good for any thing. The <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Memory ſtands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In remembring thoſe things which we ſhould forget:</hi> As 1. Things unprofitable, there are a thouſand needleſs and uſeleſs matters that fill the memory, and keep out better things. Like as if one ſhould croud waſt Paper, Rags, and broken Pitchers into a Cabinet, which ſhould be ſtor'd with things of value. There is, in all Actions and Accidents, two things conſiderable, 1. The <hi>Action,</hi> for example ſuch a Text was handled, ſuch a charitable Action done, ſuch a Man brake his Leg, was drunk or the like 2. The <hi>Inference</hi> or Obſervation to be gathered from thence: for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, whether good or bad, are intended by the wiſe <hi>God</hi> for mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Now the Memory lays up the former and can retain it a long time, but the Leſſon which we ſhould learn from it, that's neglected, that's forgotten. 2. Things <hi>Hurtful</hi> to us, to wit, <hi>Injuries,</hi> Theſe uſually ſtick in the memory, when better things ſlip out. If any body hath ſpoke or done evil to us, the memory is truſty enough about theſe. As one ſays, we can remember <hi>Old Songs</hi> and <hi>Old Wrongs</hi> long enough; yea, thoſe, whom we profeſs to forgive, yet we declare that we cannot forget them. Not but that a man may have a <hi>natural</hi> remembrance of an injury, ſo that he have not an <hi>angry</hi> remembrance of it. As our heavenly Father himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members all a Believers ſins, but puts away his anger; ſo we may <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> remember them, but we muſt <hi>ſpiritually</hi> forget them, for elſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them generally doth us a great deal of hurt, but no good at all; it cools our love, weakens our truſt, and prepares us for revenge as did <hi>Amnon</hi> towards <hi>Abſolon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.32. 3. Things <hi>Sinful,</hi> thus we can remember a filthy Story ſeven years, when we do forget a ſaving <hi>Sermon</hi> in ſeven hours. And herein the Memory is the great Nurſe of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative wickedneſs, and repreſents to the idle and ſinful heart, all the ſins it wots of, with renewed delight, and ſo ſtrengthens the impreſſion, and doubles the guilt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.19. <hi>She multiplyed her Whoredoms in calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the days of her youth, wherein ſhe had played the Harlot in the Land of Egypt.</hi> The depraved Memory is herein fitly compared to a Sive, that lets the good Corn fall through, and reſerves only the chaff; by which its plain, that the Faculty is not loſt, but poyſon'd. So that in this reſpect we may ſay, as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did to <hi>Simonides,</hi> when he offered to teach him <hi>The Art of Memory,</hi> rather, ſays he, teach me <hi>The art of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs,</hi> for the things which I would not, I remember, and cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the things I would.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42587:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. The cortuption of the Memory ſtands in <hi>Forgetting thoſe things which we ſhould remember.</hi> But theſe things being ſo exceeding many, great and uſeful, though I cannot enumerate them, yet I ſhall comprize the chief of them in theſe following general heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Creator, and what he hath done, and what he hath done <hi>for us, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi> And yet whom do we more forget? <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Can a Maid forget her Ornaments, or a Bride her Attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</hi> And our Forgetfulneſs here is moſt inexcuſable, becauſe we may ſee, taſte, and feel him every moment; foraſmuch as he is not far from every one of us, ſeeing in him we live, and move, and have our Being, and yet we can make ſhift to forget Him, which ſhews the great Craze we had by the Fall. And then, the great things which he hath done, to wit, in the Works of Creation and Providence, eſpecially for his Church; theſe we early for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get but ſhould remember, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.11. <hi>I will remember the Works of the Lord ſurely I will remember thy wonders of Old:</hi> And particularly what he hath done <hi>for us;</hi> the many and great Mercies and Deliverances, eſpecially, the moſt remarkable of them, which every good Chriſtian ſhould have a Catalogue of, in his mind, or in his Book, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. <hi>And thou ſhalt remember all the way which the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>led thee theſe Forty Years,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Redeemer and what he hath ſuffered for us. Never was there ſuch an Inſtance of free and tranſcendent Love in the World, as that the Eternal Son of God ſhould give himſelf to be a Sacrifice to expiate our Sin, and yet we that can profeſs, of far leſs kindneſſes from men, that we ſhall never forget them, can forget this; elſe he had never inſtituted the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> on purpoſe to keep up the ſolemn and uſeful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof; which Remembrance ſets a work all our Graces, our Faith, Love, Repentance, Thankfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And without the frequent Uſe of this Ordinance, where it may be had, a defect will be forced in theſe Graces for the greateſt things wear off with time, and Holy <hi>David</hi> himſelf found cauſe to charge it uopn his Soul, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 102.3. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Truths of Religion, eſpecially the moſt weighty, <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Remember ye the Law of Moſes my Servants, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the Statutes and Judgments.</hi> And of theſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12, 13, 15. he would put the Chriſtians <hi>in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, though they knew them, that they might be eſtabliſhed, in preſent Truth,</hi> yea he would <hi>ſtir them up by putting them in remembrance,</hi> as long as he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Doctrine of God, of Chriſt, of the Creation, of the Fall, of the Covenant of Grace, of Faith, Repentance, the Reſurrection (as in my Text) and Judgment to come; theſe things ſhould be ſo ingrafted into the hearts of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they ſhould know and remember as well as their own Names or the rooms of their Houſes; and yet it is a ſhame to find how eaſily and almoſt utterly theſe things are forgotten by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. How few do we find, that have been long Hearers of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> that can give any tolerable account of the Nature of that Faith by which the Soul lives!</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:42587:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. The Duties of Religion. The Scripture that ſo often requires us to remember them, plainly implies that we are apt to forget them, what's the meaning of that, <hi>Exodus the</hi> 20 <hi>Chap. Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Remember the Sabboth to keep it holy,</hi> but that we eaſily forget it, we are ſurprized by it, it returns ere we are aware; ſo that <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 3, 16. which is called by ſome, <hi>a Chapter of Remembrance,</hi> be not <hi>forgetful</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Strangers. Remember them that are in Bonds, to do good, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate forget not.</hi> All which as they ſhew our duty, ſo do they imply our defectiveneſs herein, though to forget thoſe, and ſuch like, are as abſurd, as if we did forget to eat or ſleep: For as Chriſtians, we live by Faith, and breath by Prayer, ſo to forget to repent, to believe, to pray, and to diſcharge the duties of our Relation, Callings, and all other duties toward God and toward men, is to forget Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Sins. As there is a culpable, ſo there is an uſeful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary remembrance of them, when we remember ſin, to renew our love to it, that's damnable, but when we remember it to loath it, and to loath our ſelves for it, that's ſaving. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evill ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your iniquities and your own abominations.</hi> How much of his wickedneſs doth the profane ſinner forget? Lies, Oaths, rotten Language, Slander, Iniquities, all forgotten, till God in mercy or in wrath awaken their Conſciences, and then all is ſet in order before them, either to their converſion or confuſion. Hence that emphatical charge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Remember and forget not how thou provokeſt the Lord thy God to wrath in the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Vows and Obligations to God. The corruption of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries appears plainly in this. There is firſt our great vow in Baptiſm, that we would ſincerely renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and pay unto our Lord and Redeemer unfeigned obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. This is ſeldom actually remembred by any of us, too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom virtually, eſpecially by ſuch as do directly run counter to it in the uſual ſcene of their Lives. And then our Sickneſs vows, when our Lives or the comforts of our Lives have been in hazard. What ſerious and fair Promiſes did we make? what was our Frame then? and what is it now? either then thou waſt a great Hypocrite, or elſe now thou art a great Apoſtate. But be not deceived, God is not mocked. He hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ways to wet up ſuch Memories.</p>
            <p>And our Obligations to others, which ſhould ſtick in our Memories, aſſoon worne off, whether they are formal, by promiſes; or virtual by kindneſſes received; neither whereof ſignifie any thing with a falſe or unthankful man; of whom we uſually ſay, that they have ill Memories. But againſt theſe will riſe in Judgment not only God, his Word, their own Conſciences, and the Heathens, but even the brute Creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. One of whom, even a Lyon is credibly reported to have ſpared and cheriſhed one <hi>Androdus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aul. Gel. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.</note> that was thrown to be devoured, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that that very man had formerly pull'd a thorn out of his foot in his Den.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:42587:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. The Church of God, the whole Catholick Church doth every day implicitely beg of us, O remember me in your Prayers. And holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.56. <hi>If I forget thee O Jeruſalem, let my right hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her cunning. If I do not remember thee let my Tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> And there is not a more genuine Token of our Adoption, than a feeling and conſtant remembrance of Gods Jeruſalem; and eſpecially in this Juncture of time; wherein the Chriſtian Church is almoſt every where ſo ſorely diſtreſſed, that were it not for the Scripture and former Experience we might fear to hear her laſt groans. And yet, if the ſecret and Family Prayers of very many were well ſearch't, its to be doubted that their Memories were very bad here alſo.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Our Latter End. This ſhould be much, and this is little remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by moſt men. As the Prophet ſaid to the people of his time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.7. <hi>Thou didſt not lay theſe things to thy heart, neither didſt remember the latter End of it.</hi> And the <hi>Other</hi> laments it, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.9. <hi>She remembred not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came down wonderfully.</hi> And ſo they are like to do, that remember not their end. Its true, in propriety of Speech, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance is only of things paſt, or at leaſt of a thing which now is not firſt known, yet in the Phraſe of Scripture we are required to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber death, reſurrection, judgment, hell and heaven, partly becauſe theſe are foretold, and chiefly becauſe it behoofs us to meditate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of them, which cannot be done without the Memory. But there are no deaths-heads ſo effectual to mind us of this, as a firm perſwaſion, that we are but ſtrangers here, and that our true Country is in the World to come; an heart mortified to the World, ſick of ſin, and an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frame of Soul, which being reſtleſs here, will of its own accord groan to have <hi>mortality ſwallowed up of Life.</hi> And ſo much may be ſufficient to explain and demonſtrate the <hi>corruption</hi> of the Memory, which is the third <hi>Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the Memory, which is the Reſtoring this Faculty to its former Integrity, and to its proper Objects. For when a mans corrupt Nature is chang'd, all the Faculties are renew'd, there's a new Creation of him, This is done,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Purging the Faculty;</hi> and ſo converſion is ſaid to begin here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.27. <hi>All the Ends of the World ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord;</hi> for he that remembers, what mans Eſtate was by Creation, muſt needs find that there's a ſad change; and conſequently, that there's need of reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The ſame method is preſcribed after <hi>ſecond falls, Revel.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent.</hi> And without doubt, as the Holy Spirit of God burns up the droſs of the powers of the Soul, ſo of this with the reſt, and razeth out of it many ſinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which were there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> it; for as ſin weakens; ſo Grace ſtrengthens the faculty. This effect it hath upon the underſtanding and will, and ſo it hath upon the memory: it's apparent that many who before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God, would forget whole Chapters and Sermons, yet after their new birth would carry away a great deal of them.

            <p n="3">3. By <hi>reconciling it to good things and ſetting it againſt evil.</hi> Before rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as the Heart, ſo the memory nauſeates good things, as a foul ſtomack doth wholeſom meat and delights in traſh, it can hold nothing that's good, ſo is it with our vitiated memories they cannot hold Savory and pious things, theſe things are like a ſpark of fire in green wood, it ſoon goes out, but when Grace comes and changes the whole frame of the heart, this faculty begins to reliſh and make room for ſpiritual things, when the heart begins to delight in them, the mind retains them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.16. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy Statutes, I will never forget thy word.</hi> So on the other ſide, thoſe ſins which the memory delighted to keep in mind; to review them, and in a ſort to repeat them over and over; when God hath been at his new Creation within, then the remembrance of thoſe ſins is bitter. Then the poor Creature can ſay as the Church did in another caſe, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.20. <hi>My ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By <hi>filling it with good things.</hi> For when the new creature is once born again, no new born Child doth more deſire and long for milk, than the Soul doth for knowledge and wiſdom; and then the memory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is ſtored with Scripture-Truths, Promiſes, Rules, and Helps. Then the ſubſtance of all that is apprehended by the ſanctified under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is conceived to the memory and lodged there. And then as 'tis <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. <hi>The good man out of the good Treaſure of the heart bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things.</hi> And you may commonly know what treaſure is within, by what is brought out. As if you go among vain or wordly men, their fooliſh carnal and worldly diſcourſe plainly ſhews, what Treaſure they have within: So the wiſe religious and godly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that good men entertain you with, doth evidence what is laid up in their memories, as he that hath nothing but farthings in his Pocket, can produce nothing from them but Braſs, but he that hath all Guineys there brings forth Gold.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By <hi>fitting things laid up in memory for uſe</hi> and practice, which is plainly the work of God by his Grace. For a notional memory is of little uſe without a practical. As Treaſure in a Cheſt is no way ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though there be much of it, as a penny in the Purſe, when there is occaſion for it. The <hi>Fringes</hi> that were appointed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael. Numb.</hi> 15.39, 40.

And thus the Memory is by ſanctifying grace reſtored which is the <hi>fourth Point.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. A <hi>weak or dark <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Such indeed may have a great ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive memory, as we ſee in Children, yea in ſome brute Creatures, but a ſound rational memory they cannot have; for except a thing be clearly known, it can never be clearly remembred. If reaſon be weak and the mind be poor, what can the memory be ſtored with, but from the ſenſes? And you ſhall obſerve that your ignorant people commonly have the worſt memories, eſpecially of ſpiritual matters. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13:19. <hi>When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdom and underſtandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was ſowr in his heart.</hi> Words will be remembred to little purpoſe, when things are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; And therefore labour for more knowledg and a clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Beg it of God, and according to your capacities uſe all means to increaſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Carnal careleſs Heart,</hi> that is mindleſs of good things; for thoſe things which we little heed, we never remember.<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t impreſſio fortior, ita me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria tenacior. <hi>Holdſw. Lect. p. 231.</hi>
               </note> According to the impreſſion on the heart, is the Retention in the memory. Such an heart as this can retain abundance of a Play or a Song, but of a Chapter or Sermon next to nothing; for every thing keeps what is connatural to its ſelf. Nay a good mans memory in a remiſs negligent frame, quite differs from what it was in a religious frame; and ſome Scriptures which were utterly inſignificant to him at one time, read and heard and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, have bin quite new to him at another, when his heart hath bin rightly diſpoſed. As you know wax, when it is hard receives no impreſſion while it is ſo, but ſoften the ſame wax, and then it receives it: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be retain'd <hi>in</hi> the memory, if it be not firſt re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. A <hi>Darling Sin.</hi> Any boſom Sin, as it fills and imploys every faculty, ſo it debauches, monopolizes and diſorders them all. Grace though it rule every Family, yet ruffles none, it compoſes the mind, and imploys the memory in a rational manner; It rules like a juſt King orderly, but the ſerving of any luſt breeds a civil war between one faculty and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that diſtracts the whole Soul whereby every power thereof is weakned. And particularly the memory being preſt to ſerve the ſtronger ſide, is ſo ſtuffed with the concerns of that tyrant luſt, that it cannot intend any ſpiritual matter. And therefore whatever <hi>right eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee, Mat.</hi> 5:29. or elſe thy memory will never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs</hi> are great enemies to the Memory; Theſe do each of them infallibly diſorder the brain, and diſable it from its functions. Exceſs of meat doth this, more inſenſibly but yet really; a full belly ſeldom hath a clear head, but that of drink is moſt evident, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31:4, 5. <hi>It is not for Kings, ô Lemuel, it is not for Kings to drink Wine, nor for Princes ſtrong drink</hi> [that is in exceſs] <hi>leſt they drink and forget the Law.</hi> Its plain that a drunken man forgets what he ſaid and did; and too many ſad inſtances are apparent, of many that have drunk away not only their Eſtates, their Health, their Credit, but their very Souls and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ins and all, and are grown very ſotts, for <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4:11. <hi>Whoredom and Wine and new Wine take away the heart.</hi> And therefore keep a ſtrict watch over your ſelves, and if you loath thoſe Chriſtian Rules to which you are ſworn, yet do not abhor morality, do not renounce humanity.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Violent paſſions</hi> ſpoil the Memory, ſuch as of <hi>Anger, Grief, Love, Fear.</hi> Paſſions we muſt have, but Conſtitution and Education allay them in ſome, Reaſon moderates them in others, and Grace regulates them in the Godly. Where theſe briddles are wanting, they ſhake all the faculties, as an Earth-quake doth a Country. For example, <hi>Anger</hi> when it rages, manifeſtly alters and inflames the blood, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Spirits, and melts off the impreſſions in the brain, juſt as the fire melts the wax, and the impreſſions that by the Seal were fixt upon it. So exceſſive Grief, Fear and Love you cannot but perceive in your ſelves and others, how your poor memories have ſuffered by ſome or all of them. And therefore labour to mortify your paſſions, and to that end endeavour for ſtrength of grace; ſtrong paſſions had need of ſtrong grace, as you know a heady Horſe had need of a ſtrong bridle:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42587:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> for you will find, that as there is much guilt in them, ſo much harms comes by them. Where by the way you may ſee the excellency of our bleſſed Religion, which tends to the health and quieting as well as to the ſaving of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>A multitude of indigeſted Notions.</hi> If a man have a ſtock of metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical and digeſted knowledg, it is admirable how much the Memory will contain; as you know how many images may be diſcern'd at once in a glaſs; but when theſe Notions are heaped incoherently in the Memory without order or dependance, they confound and overthrow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. As a Schollar that has read abundance, but digeſted nothing, he knows not where to find any thing, it breaks his Memory. As exceſs of meat cloys the ſtomack, ſo an unreaſonable, an unmeaſurable heaping of things in the memory confound it. Thus many read or hear much, very much, too much perhaps for their capacities, they have not ſtowage for it, and ſo they are <hi>ever learning and never come to the knowledg of truth,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. As to natural helps, as I muſt not invade the Province of the learned Phyſitian, ſo I would omit nothing that is in general neceſſary for this purpoſe. And ſo it is obſerved that as too much coldneſs and moiſtneſs of the brain is a great cauſe of Forgetfulneſs; ſo on the other ſide a convenient heat and dryneſs of it, is a great help to the memory. For the heat thereof diſpoſeth it ſooner to receive, and the dryneſs of it to retain the impreſſion. As the wax you know being warmed, receives; and then being dry, preſerves the prints of the wax. Hence ſome think that <gap reason="foreign">

Two things I would here recommend. 1. <hi>A ſober Diet.</hi> For if exceſſes in meat and drink do diſturb the brain, and conſequently weaken the memory, then certainly a ſparing and temperate diet do preſerve the Blood and Spirits in order; and ſo by conſequence,<note n="a" place="margin">

And if we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our minds unto them, our Souls will be like the raging Sea in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual agitation, and then the memory ſhattered; As in a pool of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it is clear, you may ſee the Fiſhes and every thing eaſily in it, but when it is troubled, every thing diſappears: So is it with our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Memory, as long as the mind is quiet, we may tell where to find any thing in the memory, but when it is diſtracted, every thing is hid from us.

So if you oblige your Children and your Servants to bring you away an account of a Sermon, or ſo much of a Catechiſm, you will ſee that uſe and cuſtom will make that eaſy, which before they thought impoſſible. I have ſeen ſome of an old mans girdle, who could not read a word, yet by the only help of a girdle which he wore, which was hung about with ſome knotted points, he could bring home every particular of a Sermon. And therefore charge your memories with thoſe things that are ſit to be remembred, and doubt not but uſe will make you perfect. I purpoſly avoid diſcourſing of that which is call'd an <hi>Artificial Memory,</hi> both becauſe the inconveniences thereof are great, and the handling of it unfit for a Sermon.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, that when <hi>Adam</hi> look't towards Paradiſe, he wept in the remembrance of his Fall; I am ſure, we have cauſe to mourn and weep, and weep again at the remembrance of it. To conſider not only the great guilt, but the ſad fruit of that Apoſtacy; and that as in other particulars, ſo in reſpect of our Memories, which have born their ſhare in that convulſion. And we have cauſe to mourn alſo for all ſuch exceſſes and follies, which have concurr'd to make them worſe, wherein no man is guiltleſs; ſo that, though you may reckon a ſorry memory but a ſmall fault, yet you will find that it is both the effect, and the ſign, and the cauſe of much evil. In ſo much that Idolatry and the worſt Sins are in Scripture ſtil'd the forgetting of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9:17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Few of us would reckon it a ſmall fault, to have a Servant frequently neglect his buſineſs and run into Errors, and ſtill to excuſe all by ſaying, I quite forgot it. For generally ſuch forgetfulneſs is the effect of ſupine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and therefore we have the more cauſe to be humbled ſeriouſly for this Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a ſecond Help: For <hi>every Good and perfect Gift,</hi> whereof this is one, <hi>is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, Jam.</hi> 1:17. and therefore is to be ſought by frequent and earneſt Prayer; which is the Golden Key to unlock the Treaſures of Heaven to the needy ſoul. O beg it then of him, that as he ſanctifies the Soul, he would ſanctifie this with the reſt. And you have a ground for your Prayer in that <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. where our Saviour hath ſaid, that the <hi>Father will ſend the Holy Ghoſt, to teach us all things, and to bring all things to our remembrance,</hi> And this Spirit you may have for asking, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Your Heavenly Father ſhall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him:</hi> underſtand, that God will grant your Prayer herein, there being joyn'd with the ſame, a due uſe of all other means, on which earneſt Prayer brings a Bleſſing. And you
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42587:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt not only crave this in your ſolemn Prayers, but alſo when you are reading or hearing, you ſhould dart up an Holy Ejaculation, or ſhort deſire, Lord write this Truth in my heart and bleſs it to me! This is like the clenching of a nail. And when you have heard a Sermon, look the Cheſt with <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>O Lord keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of my heart.</hi> And be aſſured, that God will hear the breathings of his own Spirit, and give thee a Memory to ſerve thy turn.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Diligent Attention:</hi> If the mind wander in hearing, the Memory will be weak in remembring. Confine therefore your thoughts to the Holy Work you are about, and fetch in your ſtragling Fancies with a hearty ſigh. Remember that Almighty God ſpeaks to you by every good Book or Sermon that you read or hear; every Chapter and Sermon is a Letter from the God of Heaven, and directed in particular to you, and you know, we read with attention the meaneſt Letter that is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to us, and we obſerve every period of it, The Goſpel is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Will and Teſtament; and how carefully doth every Child attend to every Clauſe in his Fathers Will! Now the more diligent your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the better you will remember: As you know the greater weight we lay on the Seal, the deeper Impreſſion it doth make: Holy <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.93. <hi>I will never forget thy Precepts; for with them thou haſt quickned me.</hi> The Scripture, the Sentence that hath <hi>quickned us,</hi> we ſhall not eaſily forget; when all the heart is engaged, then all the head is imployed alſo. And it is no marvel, that divers remember ſo little, when they are ſo palpably careleſs in hearing, and their wandring Eyes do plainly diſcover their wandring minds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Due Eſtimation:</hi> The more we love and admire any thing, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we remember it. This is the reaſon given of Childrens remembring things ſo well, becauſe they admire every thing, as being new to them. And of old People, the ſaying is known, That they remember all ſuch things as they care for: For when we eſteem and affect any thing, the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections work upon the Spirits, which are the Inſtruments of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo ſeat things upon it. Why is it, that a Woman cannot forget her ſucking Child? becauſe ſhe doth vehemently love it: and the like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in us to good things, would keep us from forgetting them. And to this accord that ſaying of Mr. <hi>Guentianus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag, 25.</note> That the beſt Art of Memory is to be humbled at Gods threatnings, and comforted at his Promiſes; for great griefs and Joys leave great Impreſſions on us. And therefore apprehend ſpiritual things to be very excellent, and alſo receive the Truth in the love of it, and you will remember it better; but when we have a mean and low opinion of heavenly Truths, or only a common kindneſs for them, they are then eaſily forgotten, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.16. <hi>I will delight my ſelf in thy Statutes:</hi> and what then? why, <hi>I will never forget thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Serious Meditation:</hi> is the laſt help I ſhall mention. When people read or hear, and preſently plung themſelves in forreign buſineſs, then generally all is loſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>For he beholdeth himſelf, and goeth his
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42587:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> way, and ſtraightly forgets what manner of man he was.</hi> But <hi>who ſo looketh</hi> (the word ſignifies to penetrate into a thing with his Eye) <hi>and continueth therein</hi> (that is, ſo conſidering) <hi>he being not a forgetful hearer, but a door of the VVork, this man ſhall be bleſsed in his deed.</hi> By which is not meant a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative and fruitleſs meditation, but that which is practical, that is, which digeſts the things we read or hear for uſe and practiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy word have I hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Such rolling good things in our thoughts, doth habituate and familiarize them to the Soul, and they abide the longer. This is clear in other Caſes: for if one hath received an injurious or unkind word, if it go out at one Ear as it came in at the other, it leavs no great impreſſion; but if you ſet your ſelf to ruminate upon it, and to aggravate it, then, its a long time ere you forget it. And ſo in ſome meaſure it would be in good things; give them a little heart-room, beſtow ſome ſecond thoughts upon them, ſhut the Book when you have read a little; and think of it, and it will abide; it is the ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rain that enters deepeſt into the Earth, when a ſudden ſhowr ſlides away. Hence what one Evangeliſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.75. calls remembring the word of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that is ſpoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> the other calls it <hi>thinking,</hi> when he <hi>thought</hi> thereon he wept. But herein our ordinary Hearers are ſtrangely negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; they read, they hear, they forget, for they never think nor medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of it: They turn down Leaves in their Bibles in the Congregation, but they ſeldom turn them up again in reflecting upon what they heard, and ſo their labour is loſt and ours alſo. And ſo much for the <hi>Helps</hi> to a better Memory, which is the <hi>ſixth</hi> point.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I come in the next place to anſwer ſome <hi>Cavils</hi> of the wilful, and alſo ſome <hi>Doubts</hi> of the weak. The former uſe to Object and ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. <hi>Why, The Scripture tells us, that to fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is the whole Duty of man; what need then is there of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, this which you mention, doth plainly require Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring: Muſt he not remember the Commandments that will keep them? and not the meer words only, but the true extent of them, or elſe how can he poſſibly keep them? There are <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> but there are ten hundred Duties commanded, and Sins forbidden; and how ſhall thoſe be performed, and theſe avoided, unleſs we remember them? And is there nothing but Commandments to be remembred? Are not the Promiſes of the Covenant, Are not the Doctrines of Life and Salvation to be remembred alſo? Surely this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was of this mind, when he tells in the <hi>Text,</hi> that if the <hi>Corinthians</hi> kept not in memory what was preached unto them concerning that only Doctrine of the Reſurrection from the dead, they would believe in vain, and their Salvation was in danger.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>I, but it is impoſſible to remember ſo many Scriptures, ſo many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſo many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes as we have heard; what man in the world can do it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that Perfection in this Faculty is not attainable in this
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42587:188" rendition="simple:additions"/> Life; but it is is as true, that every Chriſtian ought to endeavour to reach as far as he can. We cannot keep all the Commandments perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Life; yet we ſhould ſtrive to do what we can, and then our heavenly Father will accept and aſſiſt us. But it is plain ſloth to be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging impoſſibilities in oppoſition to Duty; I ſay, carnality and ſloth; for theſe ſame men can readily remember a thouſand vain Matters, and there is no difficulty in it: But ye were beſt to beware of that Curſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a Male, and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> If you have a Maſculine ſtrong Memory for other things, and only a corrupt crackt Memory for God and Godlineſs, <hi>ye are near to Curſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>O but we have as good Hearts as the beſt, though we have not ſuch ſtrong Memories, and an honeſt Heart's worth all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a proud boaſting; for no humble modeſt man will thus vaunt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is meer ſhuffling; for when you are reproved for the defectiveneſs of your Faculties, or the immoralities of your Lives, then you plead the honeſty and goodneſs of your Hearts; and when you are convinced and urged concerning the newneſs and holineſs of your hearts, then you boaſt of the innocence and orderlineſs of your lives; but you cannot mock God thus; he beholds the unregeneracy of your hearts, and is witneſs to all the evil of your lives; but if you have as good hearts, how is it that you have not as good Memories? for the honeſt heart is good all over; and though ye cannot remember <hi>as much,</hi> yet ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>as well</hi> as they. Do not deceive your ſelves; do not imagine that ye are ſpiritually rich, when ye are poor, and miſerable, and blind and naked. If many of your Memories were diſſected, I am afraid they would be found to be ſtuffed like that <hi>Roman Legates</hi> Sumpter, that was gorgeous enough without, but being broken up by a fall in the ſtreet, was filled with nothing but Boots and Shoos, and ſuch like worthleſs traſh, but I muſt turn now to the other Branch of this <hi>Point,</hi> which is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the doubts of the weak Chriſtian in this caſe about the memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubt</hi> 1. If no Faith, nor Salvation without remembring Spiritual things, then crys the poor ſoul, <hi>to be ſure I have no Grace, for I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member little or nothing; I hear and love to hear, and ſo I read, but nothing abides with me, I ſhall believe in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> memory, and there is a <hi>Practical</hi> memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The former is either a great natural faculty, or a particular gift: Now though this be a great help to Grace, yet it is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. What advantage is it to a mans Salvation, if he could do as it is reported of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and of <hi>Scipio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cael. Rhodig. Ant. q. p. 525.</note> that they could repeat <hi>two thouſand Names</hi> in order; or as <hi>Seneca</hi> that could do the like, and alſo repeat <hi>two hundred Verſes,</hi> beginning at the laſt, if the ſame perſon cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe directions and promiſes which conduce to his practice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But now a <hi>Practical</hi> memory is a ſanctified faculty, wherein good things are received, perhaps not ſo diſtinctly, yet ſafely, ſweetly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily for uſe. As an ill Husband may have more tools in his Shop, but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42587:188" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſeldom working with them, he ſcarce knows where to find them; whereas a good Workman, though he hath fewer, yet he knows where to find them, and how to work better with them. So thy memory may ſerve thy turn, if thou canſt <hi>remember his Commandments to do them;</hi> if thou canſt remember the Antidote, when in danger of the poyſon, the cordial when thy Spirits are fainting; if thou canſt then <hi>hear the voice behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, when thou art ready to turn aſide on the right hand or on the left.</hi> A rich miſer may have great ſums in his Cheſts or in his Papers, but in reſpect of uſe, the poor Womans Leather purſe by her ſide ſhall be readier. Be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at thy ſhallow memory, if thou canſt remember what is neceſſary for thee in time of need.</p>
            <p>Doubt. 2. <hi>My miſery</hi> (ſaith a poor Soul) <hi>is this, That one thing puts out another, when I am ſecure of one notion, and graſping for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I loſe them both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Memory may be ſaid to be <hi>Preſent</hi> and <hi>Actual,</hi> or <hi>Future</hi> and <hi>Potential.</hi> Many things may ſlip out of a preſent and actual Memory, that yet may ſtick in the memory potentially, like things that are miſlaid, but not loſt. In this caſe, <hi>Indeavours</hi> are conſtrued by our heavenly Father for <hi>Attainments,</hi> and all you graſp for, is counted by him your own; As a covetous oppreſſour that would devour every fair Houſe or Eſtate he ſees, is guilty, though he obtain them not: So every bleſſed Truth thou reacheſt after, ſhall be reckon'd thy own, though ſome of them be ſtoln from thee. But here the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer direction hath place, namely, To ſend up an holy Ejaculation, when you lock up any thing, that God would ſecure it and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in due time. Many things poor Chriſtians have thought that they had quite forgot, till the time of need came; For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chriſt had ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 17:22, 23. That <hi>the Son of Men ſhould be betrayed, kill'd and riſe again the third day,</hi> which at the preſent they underſtood not; but in <hi>Luk.</hi> 24:8. it is ſaid then, that <hi>they remembred his words;</hi> And ſo through Gods grace it will be with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith another) <hi>my Memory is quite gone, I can remember juſt nothing, I would, I fain would, but I cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Perhaps thy natural Family is decayed; for ſo far as it is organical or ſenſitive it may decay, even as your Eye-ſight doth; for as the natural Spirits abate, ſo theſe decay; and you may know that, by your forgetting of other things. As you forget Texts, ſo you forget faces; as you forget ſpiritual Doctrines, ſo you do tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral buſineſs; yet you ought to grieve for this, becauſe this Decay is the fruit of Sin, not only of Original, but very likely of thine Actual Sins, either of thy intemperance, or violent paſſions, or
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:42587:189" rendition="simple:additions"/> exceſſive cares. And as ye ought to mourn for it, ſo for the ſame reaſon ye ought to prop it up, to ſuccour it and to improve it as well as you can; and eſpecially to practiſe what you do remember; for there is many that complain they can remember little, while others complain that theſe very people practiſe a great deal leſs. But for you that make this unfained complaint, you ſhould not be quite diſcouraged. Labour to remember at leaſt the ſcope and drift of all; and though much be loſt, yet your labour is not quite loſt. A ſive or riddle in a pond of water ſeems to be top full, but take it out of the pond, its preſently emptyed; true, but yet it is waſht hereby; even ſo a poor Chriſtian, while he is Reading or Hearing feels himſelf full of heavenly notions, but when he ceaſeth, finds his heart quite empty again; O! but the heart is waſht for all that, and made more holy. Its ſaid of one <hi>Caſſius Severus,</hi> that when the Roman Senate doomed his Books to be burnt; yes, ſays he, but you muſt next burn me too, for I have them written in my mind. Oh if the Book of our memory be much effaced, yet if we can have the will of God written in our heart, God will accept the ſoundneſs of our hearts and the ſincerity of our indeavours, though our memories be ſhattered.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And ſo I come to the Eight and laſt thing, which is ſome ſhort <hi>Application</hi> of all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Magnify God</hi> for your Memories, eſpecially you that have good Memories; be not proud of them, but be very thankful. I have ſomewhere read of <hi>Simon Tharvey</hi> a <hi>Corniſh</hi>-man, that would ſo boaſt of his skill in Philoſophy and Divinity, that he could on the ſudden anſwer any problem that was propoſed unto him; And the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſays, that his parts and memory were ſo ſmitten, that he could not repeat the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> nor remember his ABC. Alas! a little crack ſpoils them. O give God the glory of this Faculty, and ſay, fearfully and wonderfully am I made: And if your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories have ſome ſtrength and faithfulneſs in them, praiſe him the more, for you have a great advantage beyond others, you have a treaſure which others want. Many a poor Chriſtian would be content to forget all his earthly concerns, ſo that he could but remember the things of eternal life. Be ſure then, that ye be truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:42587:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Let all Gods <hi>Miniſters</hi> that preach, or that write, labour to <hi>conſult Peoples Memories,</hi> and to that end obſerve ſome proper <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> in their Books and Sermons.<note place="margin">Adjuvatur me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria Intellectu, Ordine, Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> A confuſed or cryptical method confounds the memory, and a multitude of naked Heads over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it: but a clear connexion and a proper method greatly aſſiſts it. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf hath in ſeveral places particularly ſtooped down to us herein, in divers of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in one Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> in the whole Book of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Alphabetically, for the relief of the memory. That matter, manner, and method ſurely ſhould be uſed by us, which is moſt proper, not only to inform peoples underſtandings, but to prevail with their wills, to awaken their conſciences, and alſo which may beſt ſtick with them, when they are parted from us; for the work of conviction, converſion, and comfort are generally perfected by after-thoughts. And therefore ſeeing Peoples Memories are ſo weak, let us do what we can to relieve and help them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour to <hi>improve your Memories,</hi> to have them cured and ſtrengthned. Content not your ſelves with ſuch treacherous Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſatisfy not your ſelves with fruitleſs complaints of them, but proceed to a vigorous indeavour to amend them. Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is <hi>Poſſible,</hi> and this is proved by experience: Many have come by the help of God to remember, more and better than they did before; and why ſhould not you increaſe the number of ſuch proficients? It is not fit for a Chriſtian to deſpond, in any ſuch caſe, but to be up and doing. When a Ship leaks, it is not preſently caſt away: for, ſays the Maſter, this Veſſel may yet do me Service; you have leaking Memories, I but being careen'd, they may be much more ſerviceable than ever they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> O but I ſhall never attain any Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I tell you, deſpondency ſpoils all Indeavours: neither do you ſit thus down in other caſes. If your Body or Brain be weak, you will try experiments, you'l go to one Phyſitian after another, as long as you have a penny left; be not then more careleſs of your nobleſt parts. The cure is poſſible, at leaſt in ſome good meaſure.</p>

All our faculties are given us for this end, and is it not highly reaſonable that they ſhould be ſo applyed? It is apparent that our Memories have bin grievouſly perverted, and therefore <hi>as we have yielded our members Servants to uncleanneſs and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even ſo we ſhould yield our members Servants to righteouſneſs, unto holineſs, Rom.</hi> 6:19. Seeing God hath given us a noble faculty ſhould we neglect or abuſe it? can others remember the world, and their luſts, and ſhall not we remember the holy things, that refer to a better world? nay can we remember a thouſand unprofitable hurtful and ſinful matters, and not thoſe things that do moſt nearly and highly concern us? It is intolerable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> It is an unqueſtionable Duty; That fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law propounded in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6:5. and confirmed in the New, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22:37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind,</hi> doth oblige us to ſtrain every faculty to the utmoſt in Gods behalf. One end alſo of Chriſts coming into the world, was to repair our depraved faculties, and ſhall we ſuffer him to dye in vain? The Text I am upon, ſhews how neceſſary it is, as a means of Faith and Salvation. We find by experience that this faculty is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably corrupted, and therefore it is undoubtedly neceſſary, that it be renewed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> We can do but what we can, let it be never ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>

            <p n="4">4. A good Memory is very <hi>helpful</hi> and <hi>uſeful.</hi> It is not a vain thing, that is thus preſt upon you. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a great means of <hi>Knowledg.</hi> For what ſignifies your Reading or Hearing, if you remember nothing? It is not eating or drinking, but digeſting your food, that keeps you alive; and ſo it is in this caſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4:20, 21. <hi>My ſon,</hi> (not only) <hi>attend unto my words, incline thine ear unto my ſayings,</hi> (but) <hi>keep them in the midſt of thy heart.

Our way to Heaven lyes over Hills and Vales: when we are on the Hill, we think we ſhall never be in our dumps again; and ſo when we are in the Valley, we fear we ſhall never have comfort again. But now, a faithful Memory is a great help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77:10, 11. <hi>But I ſaid, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right Hand of the moſt High. I will remember the works of the Lord; ſurely, I will remember thy wonders of old.</hi> So alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119:52. <hi>I remembred thy Judgments of old, O Lord: and have comforted my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a means of <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> We are all wanting in this Duty of Thankfulneſs, and one cauſe thereof is forgetfulneſs of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God. Hence <hi>ungrateful</hi> men are ſaid to have <hi>bad memories.</hi> What abundant matter of thankſgiving would a ſanctified Memory ſuggeſt to every Chriſtian! Hence holy <hi>David</hi> calls upon himſelf <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103:2. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> By which forgetfulneſs and ſuch other means it comes to paſs, that Praiſe and Thankſgiving hath ſo little, which ſhould have ſo much room in our daily devotions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a means of <hi>Hope.</hi> For experience works Hope, and the Memory is the Storehouſe of experience; therein we lay up all the inſtances of Gods goodneſs to us heretofore, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3:21. <hi>This I recal to mind, therefore have I hope.</hi> Hence they who do not truſt in God, are ſaid in Scripture phraſe, to forget him. And one reaſon of mens impatience and dejectedneſs in trouble, is aſſign'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12:5. <hi>And ye have forgotten the Exhortation which ſpeaketh unto you as unto Children, My Son deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a means of <hi>Repentance.</hi> For how can we repent or mourn for what we have quite forgotten? As therefore there is a culpable remembrance of Sin, when we remember it in kindneſs; ſo there is a laudable remembrance of Sin, when we remember it with diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16:63. <hi>That thou mayſt remember and be confounded, and never open, thy mouth more.</hi> But alas! we write our Sins in the Sand,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42587:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> and fooliſhly imagine that the eternal God forgets them juſt as ſoon as we; though in ſuch caſes he hath ſaid and ſworn, <hi>Amos</hi> 8:7. <hi>Surely, I will never forget any of their works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. It is a means of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs.</hi> No man ſhould nor indeed can be ſingly religious; when one ſpark of grace is truly kindled in the heart, it will quickly indeavour to heat others alſo: ſo for counſel, we are born, we are new born to be helpful unto others. Herein a good Memory is exceeding uſeful; out of which, as out of a Storehouſe a wiſe Chriſtian may bring forth matters both new and old. Such may ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.1. Pſal. 48.8.</note> 
               <hi>We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us,</hi> this and that Obſervation. And likewiſe, <hi>as we have heard, ſo we have ſeen,</hi> what may be very uſeful to many a Soul. So that you ſee a good Memory is uſeful many ways.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The want of Memory is a <hi>great defect and loſs,</hi> when we cannot remember what we read or hear, why time is loſt. I will not ſay quite loſt, but its not improv'd. The Chapter's loſt; I hope you do not read only to paſs the time. When Gods Word is remembred, then <hi>When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keep thee, and when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee. Prov.</hi> 6.22. But a broken memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath heard of Gods famous Acts of Providence, but forgotten them; hath read rare examples of Gods Mercy, Juſtice, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but they are ſlipt and loſt. In a word, ſo far as thy Memory fails, ſo far will Meditation fail, Delectation fail, and Practice in a great meaſure fail. And therefore ſet your ſelves in the uſe of the means preſcribed, and all other good means to heal and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your memories; <hi>and give the more earneſt heed to the things which ye have heard, leſt at any time ye let them ſlip Heb.</hi> 2.1. And ſo far in the third uſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> Exhortation is to young people, to <hi>ſtore your Memories</hi> in the time of Youth. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy Youth,</hi> Now your Memories are freſh and ſtrong, hereafter they will be ſhattered with cares and buſineſs. A new Ship, or any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that is new, is free from leaks, but time and travel will batter it, ſo will it be with you, care will batter you, grief will batter you, and therefore now ſtore your ſelves, now a dozen Chapters, a good Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, a Collection of uſeful Texts and Doctrines will take no room, nor make you go the heavier, nor ſleep the worſe: And therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Parents, both to have ſuch things in their hearts, and to teach them diligently to their Children, perhaps they may not underſtand the ſenſe of them at the preſent, but theſe will be ready in their minds till grace and underſtanding come, and then they will help them exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As we lay ſome ſticks or fagots ready in the Chimney, which when fire comes, ſignifies ſomething. Yet a meaſure muſt be obſerved both with old and young, a Ship may be laden, but muſt not be overcharged,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42587:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> leſt all the Cargo be ſunk and loſt. A juſt diſcretion will beſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the meaſure herein, according to the capacities of the Subjects.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us all <hi>labour for more holineſs,</hi> for that raiſeth all the faculties, and reduces them to their right frame and proper Objects. The more Grace we have, the better we ſhall remember, and eſpecially better things. Grace (ſaith excellent <hi>Dr. Harris</hi>) ſtrengthens the memory always for practice, though it ſerve not always for Diſcourſe, ſome (ſays he) have ſuch memories that they can repeat vaſtly, but when they ſhould advance to practiſe, they are nobody, when others are more confuſed in their memories, but very clear in their practiſe. A grain of Grace is worth an ounce of Parts. For thereby we love truths and duties better, and it is eaſy to remember, that which we love; and therefore let it be our daily Prayer, that the God of Peace would ſanctifie us wholly, Spirit, Soul, Body, all. It is not for Chriſtians to enquire juſt how little Grace will ſerve our turn for Salvation, but rather how much may be attained and improved to the glory of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, <hi>Reduce into practice that which you do remember.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſtus Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vitae, non ſchola.</note> The end of all true knowledge is Practice. Remember his Commandments to <hi>do them,</hi> If it be a Doctrinal Truth which you read or hear, conſider what influence it hath upon the Heart. If it be a duty which is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, immediately ſet about it. If a ſin be expoſed, preſently root it out. If Sincerity or Hypocriſie be decyphered try thy ſpiritual State thereby without delay. For as a Treaſure in the Cheſt is in danger of the Robber, but when its laid out on a good Purchaſe, here its ſafe from ſtarting; ſo while ſpiritual Notions ſwim only in the memory, you may eaſily loſe them, but they are ſafe when they are once incorporated into your real Practiſe. But alas! there are too many that are like thoſe whiffling Chapmen, who come to the Shop, and lay by a great many rich wares, but when all is done, they buy few or none; ſo theſe cheapen and bid for the Pearl, but will not buy it; they will talk over all the points of Religion, before they will ſeriouſly Practiſe any one of them. Then you remember the Sabboth a right, when you ſo remember it before it comes, that when it comes, you keep it Holy; Then you remember God truly, when you fear and love and truſt in him. Then you remember your Neighbour as you ought, when you remember to do good and Communicate. Then you remember your ſelves beſt, when you remember to have alwayes a Conſcience void of offence towards God or men. In a word, then you remember your latter end rightly, when you keep your oyl ready in your Lamps and in your Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that your Maſter may find you ſo doing.</p>
            <pb n="440" facs="tcp:42587:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But I conclude, It is worth obſerving, that Holy <hi>David,</hi> among all the reſt of his bleſſed <hi>Pſalms,</hi> hath one which is the <hi>Thirty eight Pſalm,</hi> which he Stiles <hi>a Pſalm of David to bring to remembrance;</hi> His memory it ſeems had need of help as well as ours. Now the Lord grant that this Sermon may by the bleſſing of God upon it, be herein at leaſt uſeful, namely to preſerve better Sermons in your mind; ſo ſhall I have my end, God the Glory and you the Comfort. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the Marks that are uſeful in the Trial of our ſpiritual ſtate in reference to Eternity, there is none affords a more clear and comfortable aſſurance of Gods ſpecial and ſaving Mercy, than Love to the Saints. This has often reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Doubts, and quieted the Fears of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted enquiring Souls, when other Graces have not been ſo apprehenſible in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But there is no Mark which the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart does more ſecurely reſt upon, through the miſtake of natural humane Love for that which is ſpiritual and divive; it is therefore moſt worthy our ſerious thoughts, the deceit being ſo eaſie and infinitely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, to ſhew what is the unfeigned genuine Love of the Brethren, to which Salvation is annext, to confirm the humble ſincere Chriſtian, and undeceive preſuming hypocrites.</p>
            <p>The great Deſign of St. <hi>John</hi> in this Epiſtle, is to excite and enflame in Chriſtians the Love of God, and of their Brethren, the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Duties, and Sum of the Law, our principal perfections in Heaven and Earth. Theſe he recommends by the moſt affectionate and obliging, the moſt warming, melting Perſwaſives; the ſuperlative Love of God to us, and our Communion with the Saints in Nature and Grace.</p>
            <p>In the former Verſe the Apoſtle argues for the reality of the effect, as an evidence of the Cauſe. <hi>Whoever believes that Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Saviour of the world, foretold to the Prophets, and expreſſes the truth of that Faith in a ſutable converſation, <hi>is born of God; and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42587:193" rendition="simple:additions"/> every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> Grace is not leſs powerful in producing tender reciprocal affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the off-ſpring of the ſame heavenly Father, than the ſubordinate endearments of Nature. The pretence is vain of Love to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving his regenerate Children. And in the Text he argues from the knowledge of the Cauſe, to the diſcovering of the ſincerity of the Effect: <hi>By this we know that we love the Children of God,</hi> with a holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>if we love God, and keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but one difficulty to be removed, that the force of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſoning may appear; 'tis this; a <hi>Medium</hi> to prove a thing muſt be of clearer evidence than what is concluded by it: Now though a demonſtration from the Cauſe be more noble and ſcientifical, yet that which is drawn from the Effect, is more near to Sence, and more diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. And this is verified in the Inſtance before us; for the Love of God, who is abſolutely ſpiritual in his Being and Excellencies, doth not with that ſenſible fervour affect and paſſionately tranſport us, as Love to his Children, with whom we viſibly converſe, and who are receptive of the moſt ſenſible teſtimonies of our Affection. Accordingly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues, <hi>He that loves not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> As the Motives to love our Brethren, from our conjunction in Nature, and familiar Converſation, are more capable to allure our Affections, and more ſenſibly ſtrike the Heart than the inviſible Deity, who is infinitely above us, by the ſame reaſon we may more eaſily judge of the truth of our Love to them, than of our Love to God. To this the Anſwer is clear; the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of the Love of God, as a ſtill, ſilent, contemplative affection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to to the ſuperior Faculty of the Soul, but as a burning, ſhining affection (like Fire<note n="*" place="margin">Lumine qui ſemper prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ipſo ſuo.</note>) active and declarative of it ſelf in thoſe effects that neceſſarily flow from it, that is voluntary obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and thus it becomes manifeſt to the renewed Conſcience, and is a moſt convincing proof of the ſincerity of our Love to the Saints.</p>
            <p>The Text being cleared, affords this Doctrine.</p>

               </label> 
               <hi>The ſincerity of our Love to the Children of God, is certainly diſcovered by our Love to God, and Obedience to his Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Illuſtration and Proof of the Point, I will briefly ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>1. Who are deſcribed by this Title, <hi>the Children of God?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What is included in our Love to them.</item>
                  <item>3. What the Love of God is, and the obedience that flows from it.</item>
                  <item>4. How from love to God, and willing obedience to his Commands, we may convincingly know the ſincerity of our love to his Children.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To explain the firſt, we muſt conſider that this Title, <hi>the Children of God,</hi> is given upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Creation the Angels are called <hi>the Sons of God, and Men his off-ſpring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of the Title is, 1. The manner of their production by his immediate Power. Thus he is ſtiled <hi>The Father of Spirits,</hi> in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from <hi>the Fathers of the Fleſh.</hi> For though the conception and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42587:193" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Body be the work of his ſecret Providence, yet 'tis by the hand of Nature, the Parents concurring as the ſecond Cauſes of it: but the production of the Soul is to be entirely aſcribed to his power without the intervention of any Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their ſpiritual immortal Nature, and the intellectual operations flowing from it, there is an Image and reſemblance of God; from whence this Title is common to all reaſonable Creatures, and peculiar to them; for though the Matter may be ordered and faſhioned by the hand of God into a figure of admirable beauty, yet 'tis not capable of his likeneſs and image, ſo that neither the Lights of Heaven, nor the Beaſts and plants of the Earth are called his Children.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By external Calling and Covenant ſome are denominated his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for by this Evangelical Conſtitution God is pleaſed to receive Believers into a filial relation. Indeed where there is not a cordial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſubjection to the Terms of the Covenant, viſible Profeſſion, and the receiving the external Seals of it, will be of no advantage; but the publick ſerious owning of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pel entitles a perſon to be of the Society of Chriſtians; and <hi>filius</hi> and <hi>foederatus</hi> are all one.</p>
            <p n="3">III. There is a Sonſhip that ariſes from ſupernatural regeneration; that is the communicating a new nature to man, whereby there is a holy and bleſſed change in the directive and commanding Faculties, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will, and in the Affections, and conſequently in the whole Life. This is wrought by the efficacy of the Word and Spirit, and is called by our Saviour Regeneration, becauſe it is not our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal carnal Birth, but a ſecond and celeſtial. 'Tis with the new man in Grace, as with an Infant in Nature, that has the eſſential parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man; a Soul endowed with all its faculties, a Body with all its organs and parts, but not in the vigor of mature age. Thus renewed Holineſs in a Chriſtian is compleat and entire in its parts, but not in perfection of degrees; there is a univerſal inclination to all that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, juſt and good, and a univerſal averſion from ſin, though the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power be not equal. And regenerate Chriſtians are truly called the Children of God; for as in natural generation there is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Principle of Life and ſutable Operations, from whence the Title and Relation of a Father ariſes; ſo in Regeneration there are derived ſuch holy and heavenly qualities to the Soul as conſtitute a <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in man, whereby he is partaker of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of God himſelf; from hence he is a Child of God, and has an intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in his Favour, Power and Promiſes, and all the good that flows from them, and a Title to the eternal inheritance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will ſhew what is included in our Love to the Children of God.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="444" facs="tcp:42587:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.22.</note>1. The Principle of this Love is Divine. <hi>The Soul is purified through the Spirit to unfeigned Love of the Brethren.</hi> Naturally the Judgment is corrupted, and the Will depraved, that carnal reſpects either of Profit or Pleaſure are the quick and ſenſible incitements of Love; and till the Soul be cured of the ſenſual contagion, the inclination can never be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the deſires faſtned on the ſupernatural Image of God in his Saints. As Holineſs in the Creature is a Ray derived from the infinite beauty of God's Holineſs, ſo the love of Holineſs is a Spark from the ſacred Fire of his Love.<note place="margin">1 John 4.7.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> exhorts Chriſtians, <hi>Let us love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for Love is of God.</hi> Natural Love among men is by his general Providence, but a gracious Love to the Saints, is by his ſpecial influence. The natural Affection muſt be <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, as with Fire,</hi> to refine it to a divine purity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Qualifications of this Love are as follows:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is ſincere and cordial; it does not appear only in expreſſions from the Tongue and Countenance, but ſprings from the integrity of the Heart. 'Tis ſtiled <hi>unfeigned L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of the Brethren; 'tis a Love not in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and Truth.</hi> A counterfeit formal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſet off with artificial colours, is ſo far from being pleaſing to God, the Searcher and Judge of hearts, that 'tis infinitely provoking to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis pure; the attractive Cauſe of it is the Image of God appearing in them. Our Saviour aſſures us, that Love ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rewarded that reſpects <hi>a Diſciple upon that account as a Diſciple, and a righteous man as a righteous man.</hi> The holy Love commanded in the Goſpel, is to Chriſtians for their Divine Relation, as the Children of God, as the Members of Chriſt, and Temples of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From hence it is univerſal, extended to all the Saints. The Church is compoſed of Chriſtians that are different in their Gifts and Graces, and in their external Order, ſome excel in knowledge, and zeal, and love, in active Graces; others in humility, meekneſs and patience; that ſuſtain and adorn them in ſufferings; ſome are in a higher rank, others are in humble circumſtances, as in the viſible world things are placed ſutably to their Natures, the Stars in the Heavens, Flowers in the Earth; and our ſpecial reſpects are due to thoſe whom the Favour of God has dignified above others, and in whom the brightneſs and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Grace ſhines more clearly; for according as there are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that make a perſon deſerving Love, the degrees of Love ſhould riſe in proportion: but a dear affection is due even to the loweſt Saints; for all have communion in the ſame holy Nature, and are equally inſtated in the ſame bleſſed Alliance.</p>
            <pb n="445" facs="tcp:42587:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Fourthly, It muſt be fervent, not only in Truth, but in a degree of Eminency. St. <hi>Peter</hi> joyns the two Qualifications; <hi>See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.</hi> Our Saviour ſets before us his own Pattern, as a Pillar of fire to direct and inflame us.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.12.</note> 
               <hi>This is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you. As I have loved you!</hi> Admirable Example! His Love was ſingular and ſuperlative; a Love that ſaves and aſtoniſhes us at once; for he willingly gave his precious life for our Ranſom. This we ſhould endeavour to reſemble, though our higheſt expreſſions of love and compaſſion to the Saints, are but a weak and imperfect imitation of his divine Perfection.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add farther, this Love includes all kinds of Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The love of Eſteem correſpondent to the real worth and ſpecial goodneſs of the Saints. 'Tis one Character of a Citizen of Heaven, that <hi>in his eyes a vile perſon is contemned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 15.</note> however ſet off by the Glory of the world, and the ornaments of the preſent ſtate, that as a falſe Mask conceal their foul deformity to carnal perſons; <hi>but he honours them that fear the Lord,</hi> though disfigured by calumnies, though obſcur'd and depreſs'd by afflictions, and made like their bleſſed Head, in whom there was <hi>no Form nor Comlineſs in the judgment of Fools.</hi> In our valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Divine Grace ſhould turn the Scales againſt all the Natural or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Perfections of Body or Mind; Beauty, Strength, Wit, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, humane Wiſdom; againſt all the external Advantages of this Life, Nobility, Riches, Power, and whatever is admired by a carnal Eye. The Judgment and Love of God ſhould regulate ours. A Saint is more valued by God, than the higheſt Princes; nay, than the Angels themſelves, conſidered only with reſpect to their ſpiritual Nature. He calls them <hi>his peculiar Treaſure, his Jewels, the firſt Fruits of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> ſacred for his Uſe and Glory, in compariſon of whom, the reſt of the world are but Dregs, a corrupt Maſs: They are ſtiled <hi>his Sons;</hi> being partakers of that Life of which he is the Author and Pattern; and what are all the Titles on Earth, compared with ſo Divine a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Love of Deſire, of their preſent and future Happineſs. The Perfection of Love conſiſts more in the Deſire than in the Effects; and the continued fervent Prayers that the Saints preſent to God for one another, are the expreſſions of their Love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Love of Delight, in ſpiritual Communion with them. All the Attractives of humane Converſation, Wit, Mirth, Sweetneſs of Behaviour, and wiſe Diſcourſe, cannot make any Society ſo dear and pleaſant to one that is a lover of Holineſs, as the Communion of Saints. <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Breaſt was very ſenſible of the tender Affections of Love and Joy, tells us, That <hi>the Saints in the Earth, the Excellent,</hi>

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42587:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sympathy with them in their Joys and Sorrows, being Members of the ſame Body, and having an intereſt in all their good or evil. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, when the Holy Spirit deſcribes the ſweeteſt humane Comforts that are the preſent reward of the godly man, the enjoyment of his Eſtate in the dear Society of his Wife and Children, there is a Promiſe annext,<note place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> that ſweetens all the reſt, That <hi>he ſhall ſee the good of Jeruſalem, and peace upon Iſrael.</hi> Without this all temporal Comforts are mixt with bitter diſpleaſure to him.

            <p n="4">4. The Love of Service and Beneficence, that declares it ſelf in all outward Offices and Acts for the good of the Saints: And theſe are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; ſome are of a ſublimer nature, and concern their Souls; as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Counſel and Inſtruction, compaſſionate Admonition and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the confirming them in good, and the fortifying them againſt evil, the doing whatever may preſerve and advance the life and vigour of the inward man; others reſpect their Bodies and temporal Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; directing them in their Affairs, protecting them from Injuries, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their wants, and univerſally aſſiſting them for their tolerable paſſage through the world. And all theſe Acts are to be chearfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; there is more joy in conferring than receiving a Benefit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Love is more exerciſed in the one than the other. In ſhort, the higheſt effect of Love that comprizes all the reſt, is to die for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and this we ought to do when the Honour of God, and Welfare of the Church require it. <hi>Hereby perceive we the Love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> If Chriſtians thus loved one another, the Church on Earth would be a lively Image of the bleſſed Society above.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Love of God, and Obedience to his Commands, the Product of it are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Love of God has its Riſe from the conſideration of his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excellencies, that render him infinitely worthy of the higheſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and from the bleſſed Benefits of Creation, Preſervation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Glorification, that we expect from his pure Goodneſs and Mercy. This is the moſt clear and eſſential Character of a Child of God, and moſt peculiarly diſtinguiſhes him from unrenewed men, however accompliſhed by Civil Virtues.</p>
            <p>Now the internal exerciſe of Love to God, in the valuation of his Favour, as that which is better than Life, in earneſt deſires of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, in raviſhing Joy in the teſtimonies and aſſurance of his Love, in mourning for what is diſpleaſing to him, is in the ſecret of the Soul; but with this there is inſeparably joyn'd a true and viſible declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Love in obedienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>This is the Love of God,</hi> the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42587:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt real and undeceitful Expreſſion of it, <hi>that we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obedience that ſprings from Love, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uniform and univerſal; for that two principal and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Effects of Love are an ardent deſire to pleaſe God, and an equal care not to diſpleaſe him in any thing. Now the Law of God is the ſignification of his ſovereign and holy will, and the doing of it is very pleaſing to him, both upon the account of the ſubjection of the Creature to his authority, and conformity to his purity; he declares that Obedience is better than the moſt coſtly Sacrifice. There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute peremptory repugnance between love to him, and deſpiſing his Commands: And from thence it follows, that Love inclines the Soul to obey all Gods Precepts, not only thoſe of eaſie obſervation, but the moſt difficult and diſtaſtful to the carnal Appetites; for the Authority of God runs through all, and his Holineſs ſhines in all: Servile Fear is a partial Principle, and cauſes an unequal reſpect to the divine Law; it reſtrains from ſins of greater guilt, from ſuch diſorderly and diſſolute actions at which Conſcience takes fire, but others are indulged; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites to good works of ſome kind, but neglects other that are equally neceſſary. But Love regards the whole Law in all its Injunctions and Prohibitions, not meerly to pleaſe our ſelves, that we may not feel the ſtings of an accuſing Conſcience, but to pleaſe the Lawgiver.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Obedience of Love is accurate; and this is a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the former. The divine Law is a Rule not only for our outward Converſation, but of our Thoughts and Affections, of all the interior workings of the Soul, that are open before God. Thus it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires religious Service, not only in the external performance, but thoſe reverent holy Affections, thoſe pure Aims, wherein the Life and Beauty, the Spirit and true Value of divine Worſhip conſiſts. Thus it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Duties of Equity, Charity and Sobriety, all <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Duties</hi> for divine Ends, to <hi>pleaſe</hi> and <hi>glorifie God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> It forbids all kinds and degrees of Sin; not only groſs Acts, but the inward Luſtings that have a tendency to them. Now the Love of God is the Principle of ſpiritual Perfection. 'Tis called <hi>the fulfilling of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> not only as it is a comprehenſive Grace, but in that it draws forth all the active Powers of the Soul to obey it in an exact manner. This cauſes a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſence of our failings, and a ſevere circumſpection over our ways, that nothing be allowed that is diſpleaſing to the divine Eyes. Since the moſt excellent Saints are Gods chiefeſt Favourites, Love makes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul to ſtrive to be like him in all poſſible degrees of Purity. Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom the Love of Chriſt was the imperial commanding Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, declares,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.10, 11.</note> it is zealous endeavour to be <hi>conformable to the Death of Chriſt,</hi> in dying to Sin, as Chriſt died for ſin, and that <hi>he might attain to the Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> that perfection of Holineſs that is in the immortal ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">

               <note place="margin">1 John 5.3.</note>3. The Obedience of Love is choſen and pleaſant. <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> Thoſe that are ſtrangers to this heavenly Affection, imagine that a ſolicitous diligent reſpect to all Gods Precepts, is a melancholy Task, but it is delightful to the Saints; for Obedience is the continual exerciſe of Love to God, the Paradiſe of holy Souls. The mortification of the carnal Appetites, and the reſtraint from ſuch Objects as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſinuate and engage carnal Hearts, is with a freer complacency to a Saint, than a ſenſual fruition of them. The ſharpeſt ſufferings for Religion are allayed, nay ſweetned to a Saint from the Love of God, that is then moſt ſincerely, ſtrongly, and purely acted. The Apoſtle more rejoyced in ſharp Tribulations for Chriſt's ſake, than in divine Revelations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Love of God produces perſevering Obedience. Servile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance is inconſtant. A Slave hates the Duties he performs, and loves the Sins he dares not commit; therefore as ſoon as he is releas'd from his Chain and his Fear, his Obedience ceaſes; but a Son is perfectly pleas'd with his Fathers Will, and the Tenor of his Life is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to it. He that is preſs'd by fear to ſerve in an Army, will deſert his Colours the firſt opportunity; but a Volunteer, that for the love of Valour, and of his Country, liſts himſelf, will continue in the Service. The motion that is cauſed by outward poiſes, will ceaſe when the weights are down, but that which proceeds from an inward principle of Life, is continual; and ſuch is the Love of God planted in the breaſt of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We are to prove that from the Love of God, and willing Obedience to his Commands, we may convincingly know the ſincerity of our Love to his Children.</p>
            <p>There is an inſeparable Union between theſe two Graces, and the one ariſes out of the other. <hi>Godlineſs and brotherly kindneſs</hi> are joyned by the Apoſtle. And it will be evident that where this Affection of Love to the Saints is ſincere and gracious, there will be an entire and joyful reſpect to the Law of God, by conſidering the Reaſons and Motives of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Divine Command requires this Love. <hi>Theſe things I command you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that ye love one another.</hi> This Precept ſo often repeated, and powerfully re-inforc'd by him, made ſo deep an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the firſt Chriſtians, that <hi>they had one Heart, and one Soul, and their Eſtates were common between them.</hi> And in the next ſucceeding Ages, this fraternal Love was ſo conſpicuous in the Profeſſors of his Sacred Diſcipline,<note place="margin">Tert. <hi>Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that their Enemies obſerv'd it as a rare and remarkable thing: <hi>See how the Chriſtians love one another! ſee how ready they are to die for one another!</hi> Now the ſame gracious Principle that inclines us to do
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:42587:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> one Command, will make us univerſally willing to obſerve all; for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience primarily reſpects the Authority of the Lawgiver, which binds the whole Law upon the Conſcience.<note place="margin">James 2.</note> And as he that <hi>breaks the Law wilfully in one point, is guilty of all,</hi> becauſe the violation of a ſingle Precept proceeds from the ſame Cauſe that induces men to tranſgreſs all, that is contempt of the Divine Majeſty; ſo he that ſincerely obeys one Command, does with conſent of heart, and ſerious endeavors obey all, And from hence 'tis clear, that without a religious and unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved regard of the divine Commands, 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be in any perſon a gracious affection to the Saints; that is the product of Obedience to God, and conſequently the obſervance of his Precepts, is the certain proof of our Love to his Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Spiritual Love to the Saints ariſes from the ſight of the Divine Image appearing in their Converſation. Now if the Beauty of Holineſs be the attractive of our Love, it will be faſtned on the Law of God in the moſt intenſe degree. The moſt excellent Saints on Earth have ſome mixtures of Corruption; their Holineſs is like the Morning-light, that is checquered with the ſhadows and obſcurity of the Night; and 'tis our wiſdom not to love their infirmities, but to preſerve an unſtained affection to them. But the Law of God is the faireſt Tranſcript of his Nature, wherein his glorious Holineſs is moſt reſplendent.<note place="margin">Pſa. 19.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul, the Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> This raviſh'd the heart of <hi>David</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Affection. <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>it is my Meditation all the day.</hi> And he repeats the declaration of his Love to it with new fervor upon this ground; <hi>I love thy Law becauſe it is pure.</hi> Now Love to the Commands of God will tranſcribe them in our hearts and Lives. As af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate expreſſions to the Children of God, without the real ſupply of their wants, are but the ſhadows of Love, ſo words of eſteem and reſpect to the Law of God without unfeigned and univerſal Obedience, are but an empty Pretence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Divine Relation of the Saints to God as their Father, is the Motive of ſpiritual Love to them. And this is conſequent to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for by partaking of his Holineſs, they partake of his life and likeneſs. And from hence they are the deareſt Objects of his Love; his eye and heart is always upon them. Now if this Conſideration excites Love to the Children of God, it will be as powerful to incline us to keep his Commands; for the Law of God that is the Copy of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Will, is moſt near to his Nature, and he is infinitely tender of it. Our Saviour tells us, that <hi>it is caſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16.17.</note> 
               <hi>than for one tittle of the Law to fail.</hi> If the entire World, and all the Inhabitants of it were deſtroyed, there would be no loſs to God, but if the Law loſe its Authority and Obligation, the Divine Holineſs would ſuffer a Blemiſh.</p>
            <pb n="450" facs="tcp:42587:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Uſe of the Doctrine is; to try our Love to the Children of God, to which all pretend, by this infallible Rule, our Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. This is abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe the deceit is ſo eaſie and ſo dangerous: and it will be moſt comfortable, if upon this Trial our Love be found to be ſpiritual and divine. The deceit is eaſie, becauſe Acts of Love may be expreſſed to the Saints from other Principles than the Love of God: Some for vain-glory are bountiful, and when their Charity ſeems ſo viſibly divine, that men admire it, there is the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m of vanity at the root, that corrupts and makes it odious to God. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees are charged with this by our Saviour;<note place="margin">Mat. 6 2.</note> their Alms were not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Charity, but Oſtentation; and whilſt they endeavoured to make their Vices virtuous, they made their Virtues vicious. There is a natural Love among perſons united by Conſanguinity, that remains ſo entire ſince the ruine of Mankind by the Fall, and is rather from the force of Nature, than the virtue of the Will, and this in all kind Offices may be expreſs'd to the Saints. There is a ſweetneſs of Temper in ſome, that inclines them to wiſh well to all, and ſuch tender Affections that are eaſily moved and melted at the ſight of others miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and ſuch may be beneficent and compaſſionate to the Saints in their afflictions, but the Spring of this Love is good Nature, not divine Grace. There are humane Reſpects that incline others to kindneſs to the Saints, as they are united by intereſt, Fellow-Citizens and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and as they receive advantage by Commerce with them, or as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their Benefits: But Civil Amity and Gratitude are not that holy Affection that is an aſſurance of our ſpiritual ſtate. There are other Motives of Love to the Saints, that are not ſo low nor mercenary; in the thickeſt darkneſs of Paganiſm, the Light of Reaſon diſcovered the amiable excellence of Virtue, as becoming the humane Nature, and uſeful for the Tranquility and Welfare of Mankind; and the Moral Goodneſs that adorns the Saints, the Innocence, Purity, Meekneſs, Juſtice, Clemency, Benignity that are viſible in their Converſations, may draw reſpects from others who are ſtrangers to the Love of God, and careleſs of his Commandments.</p>
            <p>And as the Miſtake of this Affection is eaſie, ſo it is infinitely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; for he that builds his hope of Heaven upon a <hi>ſandy foundation,</hi> upon falſe Grounds, will fall ruinouſly from his Hopes and Felicity at laſt. How fearful will be the diſappointment of one that has been a Favourer of the Saints, that has defended their Cauſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected their Perſons, relieved their Neceſſities, and preſum'd for this, that his Condition is ſafe as to Eternity, though he lives in the known neglect of other Duties, and the indulgent practice of ſome Sin?</p>
            <p>But if we find that our Love to the Children of God flows from our Love to God, that ſways the Soul to an entire compliance to his Commands, and makes us obſervant of them in the courſe of

            <p>Farther by <hi>this man in Chriſt</hi> the Apoſtle means himſelf, becauſe he is ſpeaking of his own priviledges and enjoyments, he chuſeth to ſpeak in the perſon of another; A good man is always backward to ſpeak any thing in his own praiſe, he knows it ſavours of pride and folly; that it ſhould come out of <hi>another mans lips,</hi> and <hi>not his own;</hi> therefore he never doth it but when 'tis neceſſary for the hand of God and the vindication of his truth. And as he is always backward to it, for he is ever modeſt and ſelf-denying in it; therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of another Perſon when he means himſelf.</p>
            <p>[<hi>I knew a man in Chriſt above</hi> 14 <hi>years ago.</hi>] Some think the Apoſtle had this rapture or revelation he here ſpeaks of, at the time of his firſt converſion; then he lay 3 <hi>days and</hi> 3 <hi>nights</hi> in a kind of extaſy, <hi>and did neither eat nor drink.</hi> Several at their firſt converſion to God have found ſuch raptures and raviſhments, as they have had cauſe to remember all their life after, and ſuch as they have not experienc't again during the whole courſe of their lives. Others (for the good reaſons to long here to inſert) are of opinion that the time of this revelation was after his converſion, yea ſeveral Years after it.</p>
            <p>During the time of this extraordinary Viſion or revelation <hi>he was caught up to the third Heaven,</hi> for he calls it as ſome think, with reſpect to the Heavens under it.

Others don't like this diſtribution of the Heavens, and indeed we can ſpeak of them but conjecturally. This third Heaven which the Apoſtle was caught up to, he calls <hi>Paradice, v.</hi> 4. for he doth not ſpeak of two raptures but of one and the ſame, only he doubles it to ſhew the certainty of it. Heaven is elſewhere in Scripture call'd Paradice, in alluſion to that excellent and diligent Garden that Adam was put into before his Fall. Our Saviour ſaid to the repenting thief, <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice.</hi>

            <p>The way and manner of this rapture, he poſſeſſeth himſelf to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant off. Hence he ſays it, that <hi>whether he was in the body, or out of the body he could not tell.</hi> That is, whether he was caught up Soul and Body together, or in Soul only. The Soul is not ſo ty'd to the body, but that for a ſeaſon it may be ſeparated from it, and afterwards return again to it.</p>
            <p>While he was in this condition <hi>he heard unſpeakable words,</hi> ſuch as he neither could nor might utter, it was not lawful for him; poſſibly he was forbidden.

            <p>This divine rapture or revelation was like to be an occaſion of ſelf Exaltation to the Apoſtle, he was in danger of being <hi>exalted above meaſure</hi> by means thereof. This he mentions twice, that it might be the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42587:199" rendition="simple:additions"/> better minded. It is the nature of pride as it is of Fire to turn all things into fewel to feed its ſelf. The holyeſt Saint on Earth is not ſecure from ſpiritual pride, if one ſhould come down from the third Heaven, and bring this imperfect nature with him, he were ſtill in danger of this Sin.</p>
            <p>To prevent this Sin in the Apoſtle, leaſt he ſhould be exalted in himſelf as he had been exalted by God, there was given him a <hi>thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> this prick't the bladder of pride, and kept him from being truſt up through the abundance of revelations.</p>
            <p>By whom was this given him? By God himſelf; it was by his wiſe ordination or permiſſion. The love of God to his People is wonderfully ſeen in his preventing mercies, particularly in his preventing their falling into Sins; as here by putting a thorn into <hi>Pauls</hi> Fleſh he prevents the pride of his heart. This is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> mercy for which <hi>David</hi> prays, and for which he alſo prayſeth God. Tis as great a mercy to prevent our committing of Sin as it is to pardon it when it is committed.</p>
            <p>But what was this thorn in the Fleſh, which was given the Apoſtle to prevent ſpiritual pride and ſelf exaltation? Various are the conjectures of Interpreters about it. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is but this once uſed in all the New Teſtament; it ſignifies a ſharp ſtake upon which male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors of old were faſtned, when executed. As alſo a pricking thorn that runs into a mans fleſh or foot as he goes through woods and thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. Some think that this thorn in the fleſh was a fleſhly luſt, ſome evil concupiſcence that the Apoſtle felt to be active or ſtirring in him.</p>
            <p>Others think that we are thereby to underſtand ſome ſore temptation of Satan, a blaſphemous or Atheiſtical ſuggeſtion or injection, this is a pinching thorn indeed, and hath made many of the Souls of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bleed.</p>
            <p>Others underſtand it a of a wound in his Spirit or a ſting in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereby he was preſt down, as it were to Hell, as before he was caught up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Others underſtand it of the reproaches and perſecution of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; wicked men are likened unto thorns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Scripture.</p>
            <p>Others again underſtand it of ſome bodily diſtemper, an acute tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting pain, ſuch as Stone, or Gout or the like. Of this opinion are ſome Ancient, and many modern writers. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> freely confeſſeth, <hi>ſe neſcire quid ſit,</hi> that he did not know what it was.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle himſelf tells us, be it what it will, that it was a <hi>Meſſenger of Satan,</hi> he ſent it, though God gave it. A godly man at the ſame time and by the ſame means, may be both afflicted of God and buffeted of Satan. God and Satan both (though with a different deſign and to a different end) may have a hand in the ſame affliction, God intending the good, and Satan the hurt of a Child of God. What a gracious God do we ſerve, who overrules Satan in all his devices againſt us, ſo that he cannot have his ends upon us.</p>
            <pb n="455" facs="tcp:42587:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Thus I have briefly paraphras'd upon the words of my Text, and ſet before you ſeveral uſeful no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es from them, as they lay in my way. The main obſervation which I ſhall inſiſt and dilate upon, is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> That one great deſign of God in all his diſpenſations to his People, is to prevent and cure the pride of their hearts. This (you ſee) was the thing God deſign'd in letting Satan looſe to afflict and buffet the Apoſtle, and therefore he gave him a thorn in his Fleſh. This was his deſign in leading the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuch a dance in the wilderneſs. They might well have gone from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi> in leſs then 40 weeks yet there he made them to wander for the ſpace of 40 years, and why was it? the Spirit of God tells us <hi>Deut.</hi> 8:2. <hi>that it was to humble them.</hi> There are other reaſons alſo aſſign'd, but this was the firſt and greateſt reaſon. <hi>Elihu</hi> informs us <hi>Job</hi> 33:17. of Gods various dealings with the ſons of men, and of his various ends therein, and amongſt the reſt this is none of the leaſt, <hi>to hide pride from man.</hi> Two ways may God be ſaid to hide pride from man. 1. By pardoning it, and ſo this very word is uſed in another place, to note the gracious act of God in the pardoning the Sin of man. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe Sin is cover'd,</hi> or hide. 2. As God hides pride from man by pardoning it, ſo alſo by preventing it; to hide pride is all one with hindering it, and in this ſence it is here taken. God is ſaid to hide pride from man not by pardoning it when 'tis acted, but by hindering and keeping man from the acting of it.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew you how God deſigned this in his creating man, at firſt he made him of the duſt of the earth, and this might keep him humble, even the ſenſe of his Original, God deſigned this in his way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming man by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, we are thereby given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we could no more have redeemed our ſelves, then we could have Created our ſelves, that we are as much beholden to a Redeemer for Salvation and Eternal life, as to a Creator for our Natural life. Yea God deſigns this in his way and method of ſaving man, which is by his Grace and not by works of Righteouſneſs which we do, we muſt condemn our ſelves befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e'l juſtifie us, and renounce our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if ever we will be made righteous, and why is this? but that pride ſhould be <hi>excluded,</hi> and that <hi>no Fleſh might ever Glory</hi> or exalt it's ſelf <hi>in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, farther I might let you ſee how this is Gods deſign in his more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour providence and diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>This is his deſign in his exalting his people, not that they might be made proud, but more humble, that they might think and ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, what are we Lord, and what are our Fathers Houſe, that thou ſhouldſt bring us hitherto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is his deſign in afflicting them, therefore he brings them low that they might be more lowly minded, affliction is the Phyſick by which he brings down that ſwelling which is in their Souls.</p>
            <pb n="456" facs="tcp:42587:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This is his deſign in deſerting them, therefore he hides his face, that he may hide pride from his people, he leaves them as he did <hi>Hezekiah, that they might know what was in their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reaſon he leaves them to be reproacht and perſecuted by men.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon he leaves them to be tempted and buffeted by Satan.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon he leaves them to be overcome or overtaken by Sin.</p>
            <p>By their ſins and falls they are made more watchful and more humble too. <hi>Peter</hi> was too much opiniated of his own ſtrength and love to Chriſt. Lord ſays he <hi>tho all thy Diſciples forſake thee, I will not forſake thee,</hi> but after his fall he was Creſt fallen, and more modeſtly conceited of himſelf. Our Saviour ſaid to him, <hi>Simon ſon of Jonah loveſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> he ſpeaks to the reality, not to the degree of his love to Chriſt. He had done now comparing with, and preferring himſelf before the reſt of the Diſciples.</p>
            <p>The main reaſon of the point is this, becauſe pride is a ſin that is moſt hateful unto God: he hates all ſin, but more eſpecially this ſin. There <hi>are ſix things that God hates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>yea there are ſeven that are an abomination to him,</hi> and the firſt and chiefeſt of thoſe is pride, he hates a <hi>proud look,</hi> but he hates more a <hi>proud heart, Prov.</hi> 16 5. <hi>Every one that is proud is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> not abominable only, but an abomination in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>James</hi> 4:6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5:5.</note> twice it is ſaid in the new Teſtament, once in the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> and the ſecond time in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he fights and ſets himſelf in battle array againſt them. He oppoſeth them, becauſe they oppoſe him, nay if it were in their power they would depoſe him too; they would be God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this is the Devilliſh nature of Pride, that when as other ſins are againſt Gods Laws, this ſin is againſt his Soveraignty and his being; other ſins are a turning from God, this is a turning upon him; Hence it is that God is ſaid <hi>to behold the proud a far off,</hi> as if he could not endure the ſight of them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119:21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16:5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25:11, 23.8.2.12 13.</note> He hates the proud with his heart, he curſeth them with his mouth, he puniſheth them with his hand, for proof of this peruſe the Texts in the Margent. I haſten to what I principally intend.</p>
            <p>Is this ſo? Doth God deſign in all his Diſpenſations to prevent and cure the pride of the hearts? then, let us be exhorted to comply with God herein, let us make it our care and endeavour ſo to do. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation concerns us all, foraſmuch as we are all infected with this plague, none can ſay they are free of this contagion. There is no diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more epidemical, it reacheth the poor as well as the rich, the godly as well as the wicked, though it hath dominion only in the latter, yet it dwells in the former. You ſee how it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> you read how it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> &amp;c. The holieſt Perſons on Earth are more or leſs ſick with this diſeaſe, how therefore are we all concern'd to endeavour the prevention and cure thereof. And if any ask what they muſt do in order thereunto? the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the diſcourſe ſhall be ſpent in the reſolving and ſatisfying of this enquiry.</p>

               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:42587:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. Be throughly convinc't of the greatneſs and ſinfulneſs of this Sin, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>1</label> how that 'tis a Sin of the greateſt magnitude, a firſt rate Sin, greater than theft, intemperance, or uncleanneſs, or any other fleſhly wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis indeed the ſtrength and heart of the old man, it lives in us when other Sins are dead; yea it will help to kill other Sins that it may boaſtingly ſhew their heads, and blow the ſinner up with a conceit of his own ſtrength and holineſs; 'tis a Sin that will take Sanctuary in the holieſt duties, and hide it ſelf under their Skirts, yea it will pollute our holy things, and turn remedies themſelves into diſeaſes. I prefer this direction, and ſhall be the longer upon it, becauſe when men are convinc't of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Sin, that it hath more evil in it than other diſgraceful Sins, they will then ſet themſelves in good earneſt to mortify and ſubdue it. Then they will put it far away from them, and deal with it as they do with thoſe Sins that argue them in the judgment of all men, to be grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ungodly perſons. Remember therefore what hath been already hinted, concerning the odiouſneſs of this Sin. 'Tis hateful indeed to men, when it is diſcern'd, but it is moſt hateful unto God; his nature and his honour both engage him againſt it; he doth ſeverely puniſh it, both in this world and in the next. Pride is the forerunner not only of temporal but of eternal deſtruction. This one Sin (unleſs it be pardon'd and ſubdu'd) is ſufficient to turn us all into Hell; it was <hi>the Sin</hi> and <hi>the condemnation of the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two properties in Pride which greatly aggravate it, and make it out of meaſure ſinful and abominable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Antiquity of it. It was the firſt enemy that God ever had, this was the Sin of the fallen Angels, and alſo of our firſt Parents; this was the original of original Sin. Some have diſputed whether pride or unbelief had the precedency in mans fall. (A queſtion, as one ſays, much like that whether repentance or faith hath the precedency in his riſing) But all are of opinion that mans pride if it was not antecedaneous, yet at leaſt it was contemporary with his unbelief; and that pride was the great cauſe of his Apoſtaſy. He proudly affected to be as God, to have known good and evil. He fell from what he was by a proud deſire of being what he was not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The pregnancy of it. It is a big belly'd Sin; moſt of the Sins that are in the world are the off-ſpring and iſſue of pride. Let me inſtance in ſeveral other Sins that are the genuine ſpawn of this Sin.</p>
            <p>It cauſeth covetouſneſs. Though covetouſneſs is ſaid to be the <hi>root of other evils,</hi> yet this root it ſelf ſprings from pride; what is covetouſneſs but the purveyor of pride, and a making proviſion for the luſts thereof? why are men greedy of wordly wrath, but for the feeding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the pride of life? <hi>Habakkuk</hi> tells us, that <hi>he who is a proud man enlargeth his deſires as Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again it cauſeth ambition. Proud perſons have aſpiring thoughts and think themſelves the fitteſt perſons to preſide in Church or State. <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid, <hi>whom ſhould the King honour but my ſelf;</hi> a proud perſon takes it for an injury if any be prefer'd before him, though never ſo deſerving; and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:42587:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> he bears a ſecret grudge to any that had a hand in it, though they did it with the greateſt ſincerity and impartiality. None are friends to proud perſons, but thoſe that humour and honour them.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride cauſeth Boaſting. Hence it is that in two Places of Scripture, <hi>Proud Perſons</hi> and <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſters</hi> are put together. A proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ever praiſing and commending himſelf, and when he is aſhamed to do it by open oſtentation, then he doth it by ſecret inſinuation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution.</p>
            <p>Again, it cauſeth Scorning; Diſdain of others comes from mens over-valuing of themſelves. Compare two Scriptures; you read, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. How God hath ſaid, that <hi>he reſiſteth the proud, but he giveth Grace to the humble.</hi> Now where hath God ſaid this? You will find it <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.34. There 'tis ſaid,, <hi>he ſcorneth the Scorners, but he gives Grace to the humble.</hi> You ſee the ſame perſons that are call'd Scorners in the Old Teſtament, are call'd Proud in the New; ſo that Scorning is the immediate fruit and effect of Pride.</p>
            <p>Again, it cauſeth Lying. Proud perſons are great Liars: Moſt of the Lies and Falſhoods that are told in the world, are to avoid diſgrace and ſhame, or to purchaſe applauſe and eſteem.</p>
            <p>Again, it cauſeth Contention. The Scripture is expreſs in this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Only by pride cometh contention;</hi> ay, that is the greateſt Make-bate in the world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.25. <hi>He that is of a proud heart ſtirreth up ſtrife;</hi> he is a very firebrand in the place where he lives; he is like an unpoliſht ſtone, that will never lie even in any Building.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride cauſeth Unthankfulneſs. <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> are coupled together in Scripture. Proud perſons inſtead of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, they deſpiſe the Mercies of God, and think diminutively of them; they look upon God's gifts as due debts, and inſtead of being thankful for what they have, they are ready to think they have not what they do deſerve.</p>
            <p>Again, it cauſeth Selfiſhneſs. Pride makes men prefer themſelves not only before others, but before God himſelf. Proud perſons Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize themſelves; and make Self their principal End; they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more than God, and they live to themſelves more than to God, they are not ſo zealous for his honour as for their own, their Eſtates and Parts are more at the command of their Pride, than at the command of God.</p>
            <p>Again, it cauſeth carnal Confidence. Proud perſons are fearleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; they are ſo perſwaded of their own ſtrength, and the goodneſs of their hearts, that they can walk in the midſt of Snares, and venture upon temptation, and fear no harm. <hi>The fool rageth,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, and is confident.</hi> Pride makes men inſenſible of their danger till it be too late.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride cauſeth Self-deceit. Proud perſons <hi>think themſelves ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when they are nothing, and ſo deceive themſelves.</hi> They take Gifts for Grace, and the common for the ſaving works of the Spirit. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption goes with them for Faith, and a little ſorrow for Sin is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:42587:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> They do not diſtinguiſh between the Form and Power of Godlineſs, betwixt a blockiſh Stupidity, and true Peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Thus I have told you many, but not one half of the evil Effects of Pride; let me proceed a little farther in this Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Pride makes men cenſorious and uncharitable. Proud perſons are very prone to judge and cenſure others, eſpecially if they differ from them in Opinion; a little matter will make a proud perſon to count and call ſuch Hypocrites or Hereticks; he no ſooner eſpies a Mote in their eyes, but he thinks it a Beam; he would have others to think the beſt of him, but he himſelf will think the worſt of others.</p>
            <p>Again, it makes men Whiſperers and Back-biters. Such are joyn'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> with proud perſons. Thoſe who are proud don't only cenſure others in their hearts, but they reproach and defame them with their Tongues; they hope by ſpeaking evil of others, they ſhall be the better thought of themſelves; they endeavour to build their own Praiſe upon the Ruines of others Reputation.</p>
            <p>Again, it makes men diſlikers and haters of Reproof. Proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ready to find fault with others, but they do not like to hear of their own faults. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of a Scorner (that is, a proud perſon, as ye heard before) that <hi>he doth not love one that reproves him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15.12.</note> and in another place he ſays, that <hi>he hates him.</hi> Though the Reprover was his Friend before, yet now he counts him as his Enemy. <hi>Herod</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd <hi>John</hi> for telling him of his Sin, though before he reverenc'd him.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride makes men heretical. One ſays of Pride,<note place="margin">Haereticorum mater Superbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> that it is <hi>the Mother of Hereticks. Simon Magus,</hi> that great <hi>Haereſiarch,</hi> was a very proud man; the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Eunomians</hi> were all noted for Pride; the latter vainly and blaſphemouſly boaſted that they knew God as well as he knew himſelf. Experience teacheth, that if any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Hereſie comes into a place, thoſe that are proud do ſooneſt catch it. Mark thoſe (ſays one) that are turn'd any where from the way of Truth, and ſee if they were not proud and conceited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Again, it makes men Separatiſts and Schiſmatical. There are ſuch perſons amongſt the profeſſing People of God, though all are not ſuch that go by that Name. Theſe are they (ſays <hi>Jude) that ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They went out from us</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John) becauſe they were not of us.</hi> Proud conceited Chriſtians are not contented to come out and ſeparate from the unbelieving Idolatrous world, but they will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate alſo from the true Church of Chriſt, and caſt off all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them who hold communion with him; they will ſay to thoſe that are holier than themſelves, <hi>Stand off, for we are holier than you.</hi> Oh, 'tis Pride that is the chief Cauſe of all Church-Rents and Diviſions. We may thank Pride for all the Factions and Fractions that are in the Churches of Chriſt at this very day.</p>
            <pb n="460" facs="tcp:42587:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Again, Pride makes men Hypocrites. It prompts them to put on a Vizard and Mask of Religion, and to be in appearance what they are not in reality. Proud perſons <hi>love the praiſe of men, more than the praiſe of God,</hi> and therefore they are more careful to ſeem religious, than to be ſo indeed; they more ſtudy to approve their ways to men, than they do their hearts to God.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride makes men malicious and wrongful. Proud perſons are forward to do wrong, but backward to bear or endure it; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that others ſhould forgive and bear with them, but they will not forgive or bear with others; they require <hi>an eye for an eye;</hi> and <hi>render evil for evil,</hi> nay ſometimes <hi>evil for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A proud perſon careth not whom he wrongs or betrays, ſo he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his own ends, he makes no bones of Falſhood, Slander, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or Injuſtice, if he apprehend it neceſſary to his own honour or ambition.</p>
            <p>Again, it makes men Murmurers and Complainers; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, proud perſons find fault with their Lot, and are diſcontented with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they think themſelves wiſer than God himſelf, that in ſome things they could mend what he doth or hath done. They ſuppoſe they could guide Gods hand, and <hi>teach him knowledge;</hi> if they were of his Counſel, they could give him direction for the better governing of the world in general, and for the better ordering of their own conditions and concernments in particular.</p>
            <p>Again, Pride makes men to ſlight the Authority and Command of God; Proud perſons don't only oppoſe their wiſdom to Gods wiſdom, but their wills alſo to Gods will; they not only diſobey, but deſpiſe the Commandment of God, and ſay at leaſt in their hearts (as that proud King) <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi>

               <hi>that we ſhould obey his voyce?</hi> or as thoſe proud ones in <hi>Jeremiah, We are Lords, and will come no more to thee:</hi> The Prophet calling the <hi>Iſraelites to hear and give ear,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 13.15, 17.</note> he immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, <hi>and be not proud;</hi> and by and by he adds, <hi>If ye will not hear, my Soul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it maketh perſons to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and to ſet that up in the room of Chriſt's righteouſneſs. Proud perſons will not <hi>ſubmit themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> ſo it is expreſt in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> God hath provided a righteouſneſs for ſinners of the Children of men, ſuch as is every way ſufficient to juſtifie and ſave them, and that is the righteouſneſs of his Son. What he did and ſuffered, may by Faith be imputed and made over to them, as if they themſelves had done and ſuffered it; ſo that as by <hi>the diſobedience of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>they were made ſinners,</hi> by <hi>the obedience of</hi> Chriſt <hi>they might be made righteous;</hi> and as <hi>Chriſt was made ſin for them, ſo they may be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> But ſuch is the Pride of mans heart, that he will not ſubmit to this way of Juſtification and Salvation; he will not be beholden to another for that which he thinks he hath in himſelf; he will not go abroad for that which he thinks he hath at home. A proud Sinner ſees no need of a Saviour, and thinks he can do well enough
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42587:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> without him. Thus I have ſet before you two Decads of the evil Effects of Pride; I might have given you as many more: May all ſerve to ſhew you the ſinfulneſs of this Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be throughly perſwaded that this Sin of Pride is in your ſelves, that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> you are deeply guilty of it, and in great danger by it. Though you ſee it to be a ſin, and a great ſin, yet if you do not ſee it to be your ſin, and that 'tis in you in a prevailing and dangerous degree, you will let it alone, and little trouble your ſelves about it: This therefore is a Second thing that you muſt be convinced of; and one would think there needed not much ado to bring you to this Conviction. Pride indeed is ſuch a hateful thing that few will own it; the proudeſt perſons would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted humble: But if you look into your ſelves, you will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the manifeſt Symptoms and Indications of this evil diſeaſe; run over the foregoing effects of Pride, and then conſider how many of them are found in your ſelves. Effects do always imply and ſuppoſe their proper Cauſes: Some bleſs themſelves, and ſay, they thank God they are not proud, becauſe they do not follow Faſhions, and go brave in their Attire, becauſe they do not affect great Titles and high Places, but would rather move in a lower ſphere; but let ſuch know this Plague may be in their hearts, though they have no ſuch tokens of it in their faces. Little do men think what a humble outſide, what contempt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Places and Titles, what meanneſs and plainneſs of Apparel in themſelves, what exclaiming and crying out againſt Pride in others, yea, what confeſſing and bemoaning of this ſin to God, will conſiſt with the prevalency and predominancy of it in their own hearts. You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I diſtinguiſh'd in the beginning betwen fleſhly and ſpiritual Pride; and the latter is much the worſer ſort, and more hateful to God; he is a Spirit, and as he likes beſt of ſpiritual worſhip, ſo he hath the greateſt diſlike of ſpiritual Pride. What matters it then that thou art not lifted up with aiery Titles, with gay Apparel, and the like, ſo long as thou art puft up with things of a more ſpiritual Nature, as with thy Gifts and Knowledge, thy Priviledges and Enjoyments, thy Graces and Duties. Pride is a Worm that will breed in any of theſe. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was like to have been catch'd in this Snare, by means of his being caught up into the third Heaven. A Chriſtian if he hath not a care, may be proud of his very Humility; it is hard ſtarving this ſin, when as there is nothing almoſt but it can live upon. But I remember I was too long in the firſt Direction, therefore I muſt be the ſhorter in this and thoſe that follow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be much in the Meditation of Death and Judgment. The ſerious <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>3</label> and frequent meditation of Death will be a means to kill Pride. Some to mortifie the Pride of their hearts, have kept a Death's-Head, or a dead mans skull always in their Chambers; it is of more uſe to have the thoughts of Death always in their Minds. What is man but a little living Clay? and what is his Life but <hi>a Vapour that appears for a
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:42587:203" rendition="simple:additions"/> little while, and then vaniſhes away? Auguſtine</hi> doubted whether to call it <hi>mortalis vita, vel vitalis mors,</hi> a dying life, or a living death. One ſays of mans Life, that <hi>it is a little warm Breath turn'd in and out at the Noſtrils.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, that <hi>mans Breath is in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and therefore in nothing is he to be accounted of:</hi> And as for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon man is not to be accounted of by others, ſo neither by himſelf; 'tis but a little, a very little while more, and you muſt be gone hence, and be ſeen no more; your Breath <hi>goeth out, and all your thoughts periſh,</hi> and you your ſelves will rot and periſh; and ſhall rotting and periſhing things be proud things? Shall man be lifted up with what he hath, who ſhortly himſelf muſt not be, I mean in this world? Now you differ it may be, from other men, and are above them in riches and greatneſs, in parts and priviledges; but two Queſtions may clip your wings, and keep you from ſoaring too high in your own conceits.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who made you to differ?</hi> I ſuppoſe none of you will ſay (as one once did) that you made your ſelves to differ: you'll confeſs, I hope, that you have nothing but what you have received, and ſo there is no room for pride or glorying therein. If you excel in any gift or grace, you muſt ſay of it as he of his Hatchet, alas, it is but borrowed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How long will there be this difference?</hi> Death is at hand, it ſtands at the door, and that will level you with thoſe that are loweſt. In the grave, whither we are all haſtning, there is no differece of skulls, there the <hi>rich and the poor,</hi> the <hi>learned and the unlearned do all meet together;</hi> the dead bones of men are not diſtinguiſh'd by the ornaments or abaſures of this temporal Life.</p>
            <p>As the meditation of Death will be a means to mortifie Pride, ſo will alſo the meditation of Judgment. The time will come when you muſt be accountable unto God for all you have and do enjoy; all your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and enjoyments are but as ſo many Talents with which you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, and for which you muſt give an account. You are not owners, but ſtewards of them, and the time will come when you muſt <hi>give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your Stewardſhip.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> concludes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Every man muſt give an account of himſelf to God.</hi> He muſt give an account of himſelf in his natural capacity, as a man; in his civil capacity, as a great or rich man; and in his ſpiritual capacity, as a good or religious man; he muſt give an account of all his Receipts, of all his Expences, what he hath received of God, and how he hath laid it out for God. A ſerious Reflection upon this one thing, will have a double Effect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will make you careful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will keep you humble; you will not eaſily over-reckon your ſelves for any thing, when you conſider the reckoning that you muſt make for all things.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if this be added, that the more you do receive the greater will be your Reckoning; that is a ſure word of our Saviours, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. <hi>To whomſoever much is given, of him much ſhall be required.</hi> When God ſows much, he expects to reap much; he requires not only an improvement of our Talents, but a ſutable and proportionable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42587:203" rendition="simple:additions"/> of them, that they ſhould be doubled, that two Talents ſhould be be made four, and five Talents ten.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider the many and great imperfections of your Graces and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>4</label> Duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider the imperfections of your Graces. How much water is mingled with your wine, and droſs with your ſilver, and honey-comb with your honey, how much greater your ignorance is than your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, your unbelief than your faith; how the love of the world is as much, if not more than your love of God; if you were perfect in Grace and Holineſs, then you would have no Pride at all; how is it then that you are ſo proud and conceited, when Grace is ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? when you are ſo ſhort of what is attainable, and of what others have attained? ſhould that man be proud who hath ſo little love to God and delight in him as thou haſt? whoſe faith and patience, whoſe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heavenly mindedneſs is ſo little as thine is? Should that man admit of a proud thought, whoſe Grace and Holineſs is ſo ſmall, that he is uncertain whether he hath any at all in ſincerity? Surely the weakneſs and imperfection of your Graces ſhould prevent the Prid and haughtineſs of your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the imperfections of your Duties. If you did all that was commanded, you were <hi>but unprofitable Servants;</hi> what are you then, when you fall ſo ſhort of your duty? you neither do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you, nor as he commands it to be done. How often are Duties neglected? and how often are they negligently performed? how liſtleſs are you to them? how lifeleſs in them? how quickly weary of them? Can they be proud who conſider how coldly they pray, how careleſly they hear, how diſtractedly they meditate, how grudgingly they give Alms, and the like? Leave Pride to the Papiſts, who vainly think their works are works of ſupererrogation; let us be humble who know that our works are works of ſubtererrogation. God may ſay of the beſt of us, as he doth of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.2.</note> that our works are not perfect or full before him; oh no! the Lord knows they are full of gaps and imperfections.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Reflect ſeriouſly upon the ſinfulneſs of your hearts and lives. Our <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>5</label> defects in Grace and Duty may keep us low, but our abounding in Sin and wickedneſs may keep us much lower. Can that heart be proud and lifted up, that conſiders the deſperate wickedneſs and deceitfulneſs that dwells in it and proceeds out of it? thoſe Thefts, Adulteries, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Blaſphemies, and ſuch like, that appear abroad in the lives of others, they lie lurking at home in your hearts. How would it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſhame you if others ſhould know the one half, nay the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of that ſin and wickedneſs by you, that you know by your ſelves? In order therefore to the Cure of ſpiritual Pride, be you much in ſelf-reflection; be not ſtrangers to your ſelves, and to the ſinfulneſs of your own Hearts and Lives. Should that man be proud that hath
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:42587:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſinn'd as thou haſt ſinn'd, and liv'd as thou haſt liv'd, and waſted ſo much time, &amp; abus'd ſo much Mercy, &amp; omitted ſo many Duties, &amp; neglected ſo great Means? that hath ſo grieved the Spirit of God, ſo violated the Laws of God, ſo diſhonoured the Name of God? Should that man be proud who hath ſuch a heart as thou haſt? ſo full of Atheiſm, Unbelief, Ignorance, Impenitency, Hypocriſie, Envy, Malice, Diſcontent, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Selfiſhneſs, &amp;c. Nay, ſhould not thy very Pride it ſelf be a matter of great Humiliation to thee? Surely it ſhould greatly humble thee to think that a ſin ſo odious in it ſelf, ſo miſchievous in its effects, ſhould be ſtill ſo predominant in thy Soul? 'Tis poſſible that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may turn his Pride againſt its ſelf, and his very reflecting upon it, may be a means of the ſubduing of it.</p>

Labour after a more diſtinct knowledge of God, and of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies 'Tis helpful to cure Pride, for a man to know himſelf, his own nothingneſs and vileneſs; but 'tis a greater help to know God, his Holineſs and Greatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffs men up,</hi> but this pulls them down. 'Tis true, by all our ſearching <hi>we cannot find out God unto perfection,</hi> we can never come to a full underſtanding of all his Excellencies; but ſo much may be known of God as may make us to admire him, and to abhor our ſelves. What is man, the beſt of men, in compariſon of him? <hi>Job</hi> ſometimes thought and ſpake overvaluingly of himſelf, but when once he came to compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with God, &amp; to ſet God before him, then he is preſently in the duſt, <hi>yea he abhors himſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 42.6.</note> We never have ſuch low thoughts of our ſelves, as when we have the cleareſt diſcoveries of God. When the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had a glimpſe of the Glory and Holineſs of God, he preſently cries out,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> He had a deep ſence upon him of his own vileneſs and wretchedneſs. The true reaſon why mens hearts are ſo lofty and lifted up within them, is, becauſe they have not right Notions and Apprehenſions of God, and do not conſider that infinite diſtance that is betwixt him and them. It might ſerve a little for the Cure of ſpiritual Pride, to compare our ſelves with ſuch men as are above us; as it is a good means to keep down diſcontent, to conſider that many others are below us, ſo 'tis a good means to keep down pride, to conſider that many others are above us. Our Knowledge is but Ignorance, our Faith but Unbelief, our Fruitfulneſs but Barrenneſs, if compared with theirs. But this will more ſubdue our Pride, if we compare our ſelves with God, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how infinitely he is above us. We are no more to him, than a drop to the Ocean, than the ſmall duſt of the Balance to the whole Body of the earth; our Wiſdom is Fooliſhneſs to God, our Strength is Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our Holineſs is Wickedneſs unto him.</p>

As the Ornament of <hi>a meek and quiet ſpirit,</hi> ſo the Ornament of an humble and lowly ſpirit is in his ſight of great price.

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Text preſents you with a ſhort, yet very pithy Prayer of <hi>Agur,</hi> concerning whom we have no other account, than what the Holy Ghoſt gives in <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>The Words of</hi> Agur, <hi>the Son of Jakeh, even the Prophecy the man ſpake unto</hi> Ithiel <hi>and</hi> Ucal. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins would make each of theſe Names to import ſome great Myſteries, an account of which, I do not think to be of ſuch importance, as to trouble my ſelf or you to ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but will content my ſelf with the moſt vulgar Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Agur</hi> was a perſon contemporary with <hi>Solomon,</hi> one eminent for his Wiſdom; and that the other two before mentioned were his Diſciples, to whom in the following Inſtructions he applies himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond and third Verſe, you have his humble acknowledgment of the meanneſs of his own natural abilities, and that whatever wiſdom he had attained to, it was not the product of his own induſtry, but <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num deſuper,</hi> a Gift from above; <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man, I neither learned wiſdom, nor have the knowledge of the Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Verſes you have a ſhort, yet very ſignificant confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Faith, and that with reſpect to God, and Chriſt the Son of
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:42587:206" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, diſplaying ſome of his moſt glorious perfections, by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exalted above, as well as diſtinguiſhed from all his Creatures, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Who hath aſcended up to heaven, or deſcended? who hath gathered the Wind in his fiſts?</hi> &amp;c. Next followeth an excellent Encomium of Gods Word, that Tranſcript of the divine Will, which ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15</note> 
               <hi>is able to make us wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> v. 5. <hi>Every word of God is pure, he is a Shield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that put their trust in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Application of theſe Inſtructions you have, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</hi> Thus have I given you a brief account of this excellent Sermon; I have not now leiſure to acquaint you either with the importance of the matter, or the Method here uſed, but ſhall proceed to the Prayer that followed this Sermon.</p>
            <p>In the Verſe before my Text, you have firſt the Preface, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which you have firſt the Sum of his Requeſts, Two things. <hi>David</hi> goes to God with his ſingle Requeſt;<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.</note> 
               <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after:</hi> Not but that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Agur</hi> too doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had many things to ask of God, upon whom they depended for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had in hand or in hope; but that one, or theſe two Requeſts muſt either be ſuppoſed to lie uppermoſt upon their hearts at this time; or elſe that they were ſuch Petitions as were comprehenſive of all things ſubſtantially good and neceſſary. What theſe two Requeſts are, and how large and extenſive, might appear, if I had time to give you an account of them in their due latitude.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may obſerve the Object to whom he directs his Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> to God; Two things have I required <hi>of thee:</hi> who for our encouragement in our addreſſes to him, hath aſcribed to himſelf that Title, to be a <hi>God hearing Prayer.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. You have the manner of his Addreſs, expreſſive both of his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Fervency,</hi> two neceſſary ingredients to an acceptable Prayer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two things have <hi>I required</hi> of thee. There is his Faith. To require, is more than barely to requeſt; it imports a looking and a longing for a thing with expectation of receiving what is asked. This is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Faith; and the freedom that Chriſt hath purchaſed for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their approaches to the Throne of Grace.<note place="margin">Eph. 3.12.</note>

            <p>Here are many profitable Inſtructions that might hence be collected, did not the preſent deſign of this Exerciſe haſten me to ſtep forward to the words of my Text: where you have theſe two more general Parts.</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">I. The things pleaded for. Their Number you heard in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words; <hi>Two things.</hi> Here we are acquainted with their Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Remove far from me Vanity and Lies.</hi> This Petition did primarily reſpect his inward man, the Concerns of his Soul. Whenever we are ſending Diſpatces to Heaven, ſpiritual and eternal things ſhould alway have the preheminence.<note place="margin">Peccata omnis complectitur ſub nominibus Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis &amp; Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacii. <hi>Jun.</hi>
               </note> The things he deprecates are <hi>Vanity and Lies.</hi> By which (as is conceived) we are to underſtand thoſe ſinful Soul-Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies under which he groaned, and unto which by nature we are wholly addicted and enſlaved. This then in ſhort is expreſſive of the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Soul after a freedom from the damning &amp; domineering Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his in-dwelling Luſts, that his Sins might be pardoned, that his Conſcience might be purged, that all might be removed far from him that kept him at a diſtance from, and interrupted him in his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God.</p>
            <p>But 2. That Requeſt in which I am at preſent concerned eſpecially to give you an account of, is the next; which doth more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his outward man, and the temporal enjoyments of this tranſitory Life: Theſe are alſo the gifts of God; and though they are the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Footſtool, Mercies of an inferiour rank, yet, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Requeſt is this; <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, feed me with food convenient for me.</hi> Which though made up of ſeveral Sentences, yet is it but one ſingle Requeſt.</p>
            <p>According to the Order obſerved in my Text, we muſt conſider,</p>

            <p>Secondly, We ſhould next conſider the Arguments upon which he grounds this Choice: <hi>Leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the Name of my God in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons, though they differ in their nature and manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, yet they center in one and the ſame thing. Why not Poverty nor Riches? Why a middle condition between both? The reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a condition is in it ſelf moſt ſubſervient to Gods Glory, and our own ſpiritual and eternal welfare. It is poſſible a poor Eſtate may be beſt for ſome, and a plentiful Eſtate for others. Theſe may be the Conditions in which ſome may bring moſt honour to God, and moſt promote the welfare of their better part; but this is accidentally: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in it ſelf a middle Eſtate is the moſt ſutable to the carrying on theſe high and noble ends.</p>

            <p>Before I come to a particular diſcuſſion and reſolution of the Caſe propounded, I ſhall premiſe a few particulars for the better opening this Petition of <hi>Agur,</hi> and the main matter in hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> That God hath the abſolute diſpoſal of all men as to their Eſtates and Conditions in the World, <hi>the rich and the poor meet together,</hi>

Poverty alſo is the Gift of God, by what viſible ways ſoever it overtakes us, God is the principal Agent, and his hand is to be acknowledged in taking from us, as well as in giving to us, admit, that wicked men, the Sons of violence, are let looſe upon us to the ſpoiling our good, yet God is to be eyed.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.24.</note> 
               <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robbers? did not the Lord, he againſt whom we

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> God in his various Diſpenſations of the good and evil things of this World, acts not only as an abſolute Soveraign; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of his own moſt infinite wiſdom; and as beſt ſuites, and may be moſt ſubſervient to his own purpoſe, what may moſt conduce to his own glory, and the good and weal of his own people, 104. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24. <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all,</hi> which works of God are not to be limited to thoſe of Creation, but alſo of Providence; hence we are not to underſtand <hi>Agurs</hi> Prayer; as if he did take upon himſelf, or by his example to encourage us, to direct or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate to God, how he ſhould order out his Condition for him in the World abſolutely, that had been high preſumption; no, it muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be underſtood with ſubmiſſion to divine wiſdom and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Poverty and Riches come both from God, and I queſtion not but ſome men who have been rich, have had more cauſe to bleſs God, that of rich, they have been made poor, than others have, who of poor, have become rich. Oh how many have cried out <hi>periiſſem niſi periiſſem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I'le come more directly to the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which with theſe forementioned Proviſoes ſtand firm; That a middle worldly condition, that which you have heard lies between thoſe two Extreams, Poverty and Riches, expreſſed here by <hi>Food convenient,</hi> is in it ſelf, upon Rational and Religious grounds moſt eligible to a man, as ſuch, as reſpecting this life; or a Chriſtian, as ſuch, with reſpect to the happineſs of another life.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Point, I ſhall ſpeak to two things briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Somewhat a little more particularly, for the Explication of the Subject of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> What this middle worldly condition is: or wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall then ſhew you wherein or upon what ground this may be adjudged the moſt eligible and deſirable eſtate, both for a man, as ſuch, or for a Chriſtian, as ſuch; and ſo conclude the whole with a little Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the determination of the Subject of this Propoſition, where indeed the greateſt difficulty lies; this <hi>Food convenient,</hi> which as you have heard, is of the ſame importance with <hi>Daily Bread,</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a competency of outward good things, this middle ſtate between Poverty and riches, muſt be conſidered with a threefold reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:42587:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. With reſpect to a mans perſonal and private capacity, as a ſingle perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With reſpect unto a mans relative capacity; as he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to take care for others, as well as make proviſion for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. With reſpect unto a mans being placed in a higher or more publick Station, as Magiſtracy or Miniſtry,</p>
            <p>Now that proportion of theſe outward things, which may be looked upon as a competency for one, will not be ſo eſteemed for all, under theſe various Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider a man in his private and perſonal capacity, and ſo a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer quantity of the things of this Life may be looked upon as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency; ſo much as will afford him Food and Rayment. This was that which <hi>Jacob</hi> did deſire of God; upon the account of which, he did more ſtrictly oblige himſelf to the Lord in a way of gratitude.</p>
            <p>Gen. 28.20, 21. <hi>Jacob vowed a vow, ſaying, if God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, ſo that I come again to my Fathers Houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>If</hi> is not to be underſtood as importing his diffidence, or any diſtruſt in Gods Providence; this could not be, when he had ſo lately received a gracious promiſe of divine protection and proviſion, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Behold I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt,</hi> &amp;c. Much leſs is it to be looked upon as a condition, as if he would indent with God upon theſe terms, or otherwiſe that he would quit his intereſt in God, and throw off his Service; no ſuch matter; but only a Note of Order or Inference, whereby from the conſideration of Gods Care to be taken of him, he ſhould thence bind himſelf more firmly to him in ways of Faith and Obedience. But that which I make uſe of this place for, is to illuſtrate this competency that he had in his eye as to worldly matters; <hi>Food and Rayment.</hi> He tells us not what kind of Food, he ſpeaks not a word of Delicacies, or Varieties, to pleaſe his Palat: So Raiment, not gorgeous Apparel, no Silks nor Sattins, only Food and Raiment, ſuch as might be wholſom and convenient for the cravings of Nature, and that might cover his nakedneſs, and ſecure him from the injuries of the weather; and truly a little of this world will ſerve here. Grace and Nature will be contented with a little. With this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle conſents;<note place="margin">

               </gap>, as <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſpeaks; Food, not Sweet-meats; Raiment, though without ornament: And indeed food and raiment is all upon the matter this world affords; other things are but ſuperfluous, tending more to delight than neceſſity; which without ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wiſdom, prove great hinderances, rather than helps to a happy Eternity. Now wherein a competency lies here, is obvious to every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We will conſider a man with reſpect to his relative Capacity. One whom the Law of God and Nature hath obliged to take care of and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42587:210" rendition="simple:additions"/> make proviſion for himſelf and others too. Thus Parents, Maſters, and Heads of Families, and theſe of different ſizes, call for a diſtinct conſideration as to the ſtating of a competency for them.

            <p n="3">3.

And for Miniſters, whom God hath called to that honourable Work of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.13, 15.</note> in order to which they are enjoyn'd <hi>to give attendance to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to exhortation, to doctrine, and to meditate upon theſe things, and give themſelves wholly to them, that their profiting may appear to all.</hi> So much is ſuppoſed to be neceſſary for a competency for them, as may free them from worldly diſtractions,<note place="margin">Acts 6.2, 4.</note> and that they be not neceſſitated <hi>to ſerve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> Yet doth not this either juſtifie Magiſtrates in the unreaſonble Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or Oppreſſions of their People, peeling and polling them, for the maintaining of their Pride and Luxury; contrary both to divine Precept and Pattern. The Precept you have, Deut. 17.16, 17. <hi>He ſhall not multiply Horſes to himſelf, nor cauſe the People to return to Egypt, to the end that he ſhould multiply Horſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither ſhall he multiply Wives to himſelf, that his heart turn not away; neither ſhall he greatly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply to himſelf Silver and Gold:</hi> And for a Pattern, take good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Nehem. 5.15. <hi>The former Governors that had been before me, were chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the People, and had taken of them Bread and Wine, beſide forty She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels of Silver, yea even their Servants bare rule over the People; but ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God.</hi>

            <p>Having thus ſhewed you in what reſpects we are to judge of a Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, or middle worldly condition, I proceed to ſhew you wherein this condition is the moſt eligible and deſirable, and this both upon Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Religious Grounds. Only one thing remember, that when I am recommending a middle ſtate in the world, it muſt be ſuppos'd, that there is no worldly condition that can be propos'd as ſo deſirable, but what hath its adherent Vanities; as hath excellently been declared in this Morning-Exerciſe from another Subject. <hi>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 6.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>all the days of his vain life which he ſpendeth as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which let me add further, Neither is there any condition ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but what may by the Grace of God influencing the Heart, be improv'd for holy and happy purpoſes; and yet ſo far as ſeems ſutable to ſound Reaſon, as alſo Scripture-Revelation, a middle worldly eſtate is moſt eligible; and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For a man conſidered as ſuch, with reſpect to his ſhort paſſage through this world; ſtill this is to be underſtood with ſubmiſſion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure. Let us look upon man as a Creature placed by God to act a Part upon the Stage of this world for a few years, and then to have his <hi>Exit;</hi> and thus think upon him abſtracted from all conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a future ſtate. Could it be ſuppoſed that thoſe Expreſſions of <hi>Solomon,</hi> were to be conſtrued in the Epicures or Atheiſt's ſence, That <hi>that which befals the Sons of men, befalleth Beaſts, even one thing befalleth them;</hi>

But ſuppoſe man as making a ſhort through-fare from the Womb to the Tomb, and ſo a middle condition is moſt eligible; and that,
<list>
                  <item>1. With reſpect to his Mind.</item>
                  <item>2. With reſpect to his Body.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the Mind, a middle ſtate is moſt eligible, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a greater ſedateneſs and tranquility; and freeing it from many diſtractions, and manifold anxieties, that are the natural concomitants of both the forementioned Extreams of Poverty and Riches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for Poverty, it is obvious to every eye. (eſpecially if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.) O what daily Tortures and wracking thoughts, what ſolicitous
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:42587:211" rendition="simple:additions"/> cares the mind of man under ſuch circumſtances is expoſed to! and that for the getting of ſuch Proviſion as is neceſſary to ſatisfie the cravings of Nature, whoſe cries and clamors are loud and troubleſome, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and querulous; not a day, nor ſcarce an hour, but the mind is put upon the contriving an anſwer to thoſe repeated Queries, what ſhall I eat? and what ſhall I drink? and wherewith ſhall I be cloathed?</p>
            <p>Nor, 2. Is the mind ever a whit the more at eaſe, by being brought into the other Extream of Riches, as through our folly we are apt to imagine. Oh: ſays the poor man, could I but compaſs ſuch an Eſtate; could I get ſuch a Bank of Money into my Coffers, then I ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: but alas, this is a grand Miſtake; for though Riches ſtop the mouth, and ſatisfie the cravings of Nature, yet do they open the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouths, and enlarge the cravings of ſo many devouring Luſts, that the rich man, where his heart is not renewed by Grace, is leſs at quiet, and fuller of diſturbance than the poor. Sometimes his Pride, ſometimes his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſometimes his Covetouſneſs, and ſometimes a whole Kennel of Luſts are let looſe upon him, that eats out all that comfort and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which otherwiſe might reſult from his plentiful Enjoyments; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a middle condition in the world, though 'tis far from giving any true reſt to the mind of man, (that being the peculiar property of God, and an intereſt in him to do) yet does it free a man much from thoſe diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets before mentioned; for though a man in this eſtate, may be ſuppoſed to have the ſame diſturbing and devouring Luſts, yet are they kept much under a reſtraint, not having that fewel to feed them, which Riches afford, and which are of that nature, that the more they are uſed, the more inſatiable they are in their cravings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A middle worldly Eſtate to a man, as ſuch, is better than either of the Extreams, with reſpect to the Body; and that as it is a condition that hath a greater tendency to its health, and preventing manifold Diſeaſes and Infirmities, to which it is liable whilſt in this lower world. 'Tis true, all Sickneſſes and bodily Diſtempers, that are either afflictive or deſtructive to mans Body, are at the diſpoſe of God, in whoſe hands are all our times: <hi>He kills, and he makes alive; he wounds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 32 39.</note> 
               <hi>and he heals:</hi> He ſays to them as the <hi>Centurion</hi> to his Servants, <hi>go, and they go; come, and they come; do this, and they do it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8.9.</note> So that our Lives and Healths have no abſolute dependance upon ſecondary Cauſes; yet it muſt be acknowledged in the ordinary way of his Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idence, he diſpences the weal or wo of the Body by external means.</p>
            <p>Now 1. As to Poverty; how many viſible hazards do thoſe that are poor run as to their Health? and how many ways do bodily Infirmities beſet them? Sometimes through the want of theſe Creature-accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that God in the ordinary way of his Providence hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the upholding of the Fabrick of Nature, and repairing its dilapidations to which it is incident for want of ſupplies. Little do you think, who ſit down at your well ſpred Tables, how many of your poor Brethren would be glad of your Fragments; whoſe Lamp of Life
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42587:212" rendition="simple:additions"/> dwindles away ſometimes for want of Oyl to feed it; beſides exceſſive Heats and Colds contracted by their Labours and Pains that they are at to fill their bellies, and cover their nakedneſs; as alſo unwholſom Diet, and many times not enough of that neither.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to Riches, theſe are ſo far from preventing theſe bodily Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that commonly they haſten and heighten them; proving temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to thoſe who are deſtitute of Gods Grace, to ſloth and idleneſs; upon the account of which the Body, like a ſtanding Pool, contracts filth and mud, ſo the Body groſs humors, to its great prejudice; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hereby is occaſioned Intemperance and Exceſs in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which proves not only pernicious to the Soul, but alſo deſtructive to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ealth of the Body: as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaking of the Epicures of his days, makes this Remark, <hi>Dum invitant ad coenam, efferunt ad ſepulchrum.</hi> How many freſh inſtances might be produced, wherein it might appear that many have ſo long drank Healths to others, that they have drank away their own; whilſt a middle worldly condition tends to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting many of thoſe evils by which the Body as well as the Soul ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. But I haſten to the ſecond Head of Arguments.</p>
            <p>Secondly. A middle worldly condition is moſt eligible to a man as a Chriſtian, and as deſigning the happineſs of the other world; as it is moſt ſubſervient to the living to God here, and living with God hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This (my Brethren) if we be in our right minds, is and ought to be the main ſcope and buſineſs of our Lives. Hence that worldly condition that may rationally be judged moſt conducing to that end, is doubtleſs the moſt eligible.</p>
            <p>Now that a middle ſtate (conſidering our preſent Circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe internal depravities with which we are infected) is the moſt deſirable, I ſhall endeavour to evince.</p>
            <p>This world and the time allotted for our abode here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <hi>the time for our acquainting our ſelves with God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 22.21.</note> 
               <hi>that we may be at peace, and that all good may come unto us,</hi> all the good that God hath promiſed, and that Chriſt hath purchaſed. Now that condition that may afford moſt helps, and feweſt hinderances to this great Buſineſs, is certainly the moſt eligible condition. I have only this to premiſe by way of Caution, that there is no condition in the world ſo well circumſtantiated, that can be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive of us to our future happineſs, but that without the Almighty and out-ſtretched Arm of Sovereign Grace, we ſhall ſtill be left in a loſt and periſhing condition; yet we do affirm there are ſome conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, that though they are not in the leaſt auxiliary to God, <hi>(who worketh in us to will and to do,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>and that of his good pleaſure)</hi> yet are they (if wiſely managed) advantageous unto us, for our improving thoſe helps, by which God is pleaſed to communicate his Grace to us. In this reſpect the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> prefers a ſingle before a married condition. <hi>He that is unmarried, careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 32, 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>but he that is married, careth for the things that are of the world, how be may pleaſe his Wife, &amp;c.</hi> By which the Apoſtle ſhews
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42587:212" rendition="simple:additions"/> the advantage in ſome reſpects, that the ſingle perſon hath beyond thoſe who are married, in the Service of God; ſo alſo a middle condition ſeems to have the advantage of both the forementioned Extreams; and this will be more evident, if we conſider that there are three things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite, and neceſſarily to be minded by us in order to our future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A right and orderly entring into the way of ſalvation by the door of ſound Regeneration and Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Progreſs in that way, by a holy and heavenly Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A Perſeverance in that way of Faith and Holineſs to the end, againſt all internal or external oppoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a middle worldly condition appears both from Rational and Scripture accounts to be the moſt ſubſervient unto all theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as ever truly deſign to enter into Heaven when they die, muſt get into the way that leads thither whilſt they live.<note place="margin">Mat: 7.13, 14.</note> Now <hi>every way hath an entrance that leads to it.</hi> The entrance into this way is by the Door of Regeneration: So our bleſſed Saviour plainly tells us, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except a man he born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And what this new Birth imports, you may find, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> To which I might add many parallel places.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.3.</note> 
               <hi>Except ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> No Converſion, no Salvation. Now that Condition in the world from whence reſults the feweſt Hinderances, and the moſt Helps for our entrance in at this ſtrait Gate, is doubtleſs the moſt eligible; and this a middle ſtate doth.</p>
            <p>Beloved, Converſion and Regeneration is a mighty work, whatever the world think of it. The Mind muſt be enlightned, the Conſcience muſt be awakened, the Will muſt be inclined, the Affections muſt be ſpiritualized, and the Grace by which all theſe Operations muſt be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as it comes from God, ſo is it ordinarily conveyed to us through thoſe outward Means which he hath inſtituted for that end; on which God requires our conſtant and conſcientious Attendance, ſuch as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Reading and Hearing the Word read and preached. Theſe are <hi>the Poſts of Wiſdoms Gates, where we are bound to wait.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8.34.</note> Theſe are the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters at which we muſt lie, if ever we expect the Cure of our Soul-maladies. In a word, theſe are the ordinary Means by which God conveys <hi>his Spirit,</hi> that unites the Soul to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.3.</note> and thence communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the firſt formations of Spiritual Life.</p>
            <p>Now a middle worldly Eſtate is the moſt ſubſervient (conſidering our corrupt ſtate) both as to our attendance upon, and diligent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of theſe external Helps, in order to Gods conveying his Grace to us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:42587:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. Take a man under that Extream of Poverty, one that is forced either to beg, or earn his daily Bread before he eateth it, and withal conſider him as in his natural ſtate, dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and without any ſerious ſenſe of the ineſtimable worth of his Soul, or weight of Eternity. Alas, how eaſily are ſuch, from the ſenſe of their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drawn either to a total neglect of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eans of Grace, or to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuperficial attendance upon it? Does not experience tell us, that the pinching neceſſities of the Body eaſily induce them to conclude, that they muſt have Bread for themſelves and Families; What, ſay they, we muſt live, we muſt not ſtarve; but conſider not in the mean time, that there is a far greater <hi>Muſt</hi> for their Souls, that they <hi>muſt</hi> have their ſins pardoned, that God <hi>muſt</hi> be reconciled, that they <hi>muſt</hi> have Chriſt and his Grace, and that their Natures <hi>muſt</hi> be changed, and their ſins ſubdued, or elſe verily they <hi>muſt</hi> to Hell, where they will not be allowed ſo much as <hi>a drop of water to cool their Tongues;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16.24.</note> and in order to this, that they muſt find time to pray, read and hear Gods Word; and they muſt meditate, and take pains to acquaint themſelves with the matters of their Souls. But alas, the feeling of their bodily wants have got a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, and ſtand as a ſtrong guard to keep out every ſuch ſerious thought from entring into their minds; and if at any time they thruſt in upon them, how quickly are they ejected? and the poor man is apt to think, if he doth not ſpeak it out, that whatever may be the duty of his Betters, as he calls them, yet he preſumes he may be excuſed, and that he hath a ſufficient Apology to live without minding ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h matters, having ſo many worldly Cares and Concerns upon him. Theſe and ſuch like are too frequently the prevailing Suggeſtions of thoſe who are under that Extream of Poverty.</p>
            <p>Well, but then 2. Let us conſider the other Extream, and look to the Rich; and here let me uſe the words of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, ſurely theſe are poor, they are fooliſh; for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God. I will get me unto the great men, and will ſpeak unto them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God:</hi> But alas, ſee what Return is made upon this Inqueſt: Why, he tells you, <hi>Theſe have altogether broken the yoke, and burſt the bond,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poverty hath many hinderances, but Riches through the horrible ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of mans Heart, hath more; as our Saviour intimates. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And again I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> not that Riches in themſelves are any impediment to true and ſerious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: but only by reaſon of the depravity of our Natures, that cleave ſo faſt, and are ſo cloſely wedded to, and lifted up with things here below;<note place="margin">Vermis divitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> Pride being the Worm that naturally breedeth in Riches. 'Tis a hard matter to be high and humble. Great and rich men are eaſily drawn to a neglect and contempt of the Means of Grace, and to imagine
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42587:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> that it is beneath their grandeur to have the worſhip of God in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; or at beſt,<note place="margin">Difficile eſt ut praeſentibus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis quis frua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; futuris, ut de Jdeliciis ad delicias tranſeat, <hi>Hier.</hi>
               </note> that it is more proper for their Chaplains to manage than themſelves: theſe are too great to be dealt plainly with about the Concerns of their Souls, and are apt to think <hi>Nathan</hi> was a little too bold, when he ſaid to King <hi>David, Thou art the man,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7. I muſt profeſs when my thoughts have been taken up with ſuch Objects, they have been ſo far from being envied by me, that of all conditions of men in the world, I have looked upon them as the Objects of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pity: I mean ſuch great and rich ones, whoſe wealth and honour is imployed as a ſhield to defend them againſt the faithful monitions of ſuch as are lovers of, and well wiſhers to immortal Souls. Hereby their luſts are ſecured, and their Souls expoſed to eminent danger: Beſides, how open do they lie to ſuch Soul-deſtroying Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> that there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor need any other than an external baptiſmal Regeneration, and that we are all Chriſtians good enough by our natural, and no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any new Birth, and that a little outward Reformation will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us, though we never mind heart-renovation; and if men will not preach and propheſie ſuch ſmooth things, they ſhall not by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent propheſie at all; like thoſe of old, <hi>who ſay to the Seers, ſee not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 30.10.</note> 
               <hi>and to the Prophets, propheſie not; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits.</hi> In a word, when a ſinner is converted, and brought home to God, the Heart muſt be ſearch'd and ranſack'd, his falſe hopes, and ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, upon which they are built, muſt be batter'd down; Pride and Self-confidence muſt be brought low, and a man muſt become <hi>as a little Child.</hi> Now though our hearts are all of us oppoſite to this work,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.3.</note> and nothing ſhort of omnipotent Grace can thus bring the heart to ſtoop, that it may enter in at this ſtrait Gate that leads to life; yet Greatneſs and Riches in the world through the corruption of mans Nature, does much magnifie the oppoſition that is made againſt God on this account: but now a middle ſtate in the world is exempted from theſe additional hinderances, Neither hath the Fleſh nor the Devil that advantage to obſtruct this work of Regeneration, that either of the other Extreams have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Requiſite to our eternal happineſs, is a progreſs in this way of Life, by maintaining an holy and heavenly converſation. God hath ſaid, let who will or dare contradict it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> This Holineſs of heart and Life conſiſts in our fiducial dependance upon Gods Promiſes, and in a ſincere and hearty reſpect to all Gods Precepts, in the making the Word of God our Rule, and the Glory of God, with the Salvation of our Souls, our main and ultimate end; and this in the whole courſe of our Lives and Converſations. This is that Trade of Godlineſs in which we muſt be exerciſing our ſelves whilſt we live, if we deſign to be really happy when we die.

But thus to ſay, would doubtleſs be a condemning of the generation of the righteous (one thing which God abhors) ſome of whom in all Ages have been brought to ſuch great ſtraights, that they have been neceſſitated to beg or ſtarve.

            <p>Now ſuppoſing a Child of God under the Extream of Poverty, though <hi>de jure</hi> this ought not, yet <hi>de facto</hi> it does prove very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to this Trade of Godlineſs; and this many times ſeveral ways; ſometimes it does neceſſitate them to abſent themſelves from thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, and thoſe Soul quickning Opportunities which others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, whereby their hearts might be kept up warm and lively for God. Are there not many at this day (whilſt you can ſpare ſo much time as to come hither in a morning to gather up this heavenly Manna that falls at your doors) who are forced (poor hearts) to be hard at their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and that to get Neceſſaries for themſelves and Families. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (though that is ſad I confeſs) are they overpowered by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to uſe indirect means for the relieving their wants; which upon a review, make ſad work in their Conſciences, and ſet them many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees back in the way of holineſs.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they are ſo diſpirited with the weight of their Burdens, that they are almoſt totally uncapable of doing any thing in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or particular Callings, not knowing how to pray, nor how to work, Oh the Temptations that ſuch poor Souls are under to Diſtruſt, to Murmuring and Repining, to Unthankfulneſs and Diſcontent; every of which are very prejudicial to the life of Holineſs.</p>

Suppoſe a man to be great, and (in the main) good and godly too; a rarity; but withal a ſingular bleſſing to the ages and places in which they live; alaſs, how difficult is it for ſuch to thrive in Godlineſs, when they are under the bright rays of worldly proſperity! do we not too often ſind, that riches prove to a godly man, what the Ivy doth to the Oak? which indeed may ſeem

What Temptations are ſuch daily encountering with, to carnal pleaſure and ſenſuality, to ſloth and fleſhly eaſe, to pride and ambition, all which ſo far as they are indulged prove to the detriment of ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, how apt are ſuch to be flattered? nay even by good men to be cryed up as <hi>none ſuch</hi> in their age, if they ſpeak but now and then a few good words, and ſhew a little countenance to religion; when upon a ſtrict view it may be, they have very little (if any thing at all) of the power of godlineſs; which have given occaſion to that unhappy ſaying <hi>that a little Religion goes a great way with great men,</hi> whenas in truth that which might paſs for great Religion in perſons of an inferior condition, ſhould be eſteemed but little in thoſe, whom God hath fixt in a higher orb, and ſo are under greater Obligations from God, and in a greater capacity of bringing more honour unto God.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter the Apoſtle diſcourſing about the great Point of Election and Reprobation, comes to an Inſtance in Gods wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> who were formerly Gods People, are now under Unbelief; and the <hi>Gentile,</hi> a ſtranger to his Covenant, hath now obtained Mercy. This Doctrine and Providence of God both together, doth fill the Apoſtle with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this Admiration breaks out into theſe words, <hi>Oh the Depths of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God! How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Text therefore we have exemplified our Subject in hand, thus;
<q>There are Doctrines and Providences which tranſcend our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſhall firſt offer ſome <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> by propoſing to you ſome of thoſe Doctrines, and ſome of thoſe Providences; and then ſhall come to ſhew <hi>How they may be graciouſly Improved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will begin with the <hi>Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That there are ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> contained in the ſacred Scripture, which tranſcend the largeſt create Capacity, will with much conviction appear to any, that will with any intention of mind fix their thoughts
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:42587:218" rendition="simple:additions"/> on thoſe Doctrines which I ſingle out and inſiſt on. 'Tis true there are ſome Doctrines ſo plainly reveal'd in Scripture, that he that runs may read 'em, eſpecially ſuch as do principally concern Salvation, but even theſe contain in them ſomewhat extraordinary and ſurprizing; there are ſome neceſſary Points ſo plainly revealed in Holy Writ, that to be acquainted with and believe the Scriptures, and yet not believe the Truth of theſe, is impoſſible; but then, there are alſo other Points, which, as they are not very clearly reveal'd, ſo they are <hi>ſo deep,</hi> and <hi>profound,</hi> that the framing diſtinct Conceptions of them, is beyond our reach.</p>
            <p>Though we may be ſatisfied that 'tis a <hi>Truth,</hi> yet we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>how</hi> it ſhould be; there is ſomewhat that lies deep, out of our view, which after the utmoſt ſtudy, cannot be found out. Not that Goſpel-Truths <hi>contrad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct</hi> our ſoundeſt reaſonings, but do tranſcend them.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Contradicting,</hi> and a <hi>Tranſcending</hi> our Reaſon. What contradicts our Reaſon, is not, it <hi>cannot</hi> be received by us; but what tranſcends, <hi>may;</hi> yea, in many caſes muſt be entertained and embraced. That what contradicts our Reaſon, is not to be received, nor can it be a part of true Religion, is manifeſt, in that whatever is ſo, has nothing of Reaſon in it; 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and rather ſuted unto the nature of Brutes, than unto that of Men, which is Rational. True Religion is deſigned for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rational Powers in their Actings and Exerciſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be ſomewhat agreeable unto Reaſon, and not what is contrary unto it. What is contrary unto Reaſon, muſt be rejected, and by no means embraced as a part thereof. In like manner all Contradictions muſt be exploded as unreaſonable. God lays no man under the Oliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believing what cannot poſſibly be true; and our ſoundeſt Reaſon aſſures us, that to believe Contradictions, is to believe what cannot be true. But though what is contrary to Reaſon, muſt not be received as an Article of our Creed, yet what tranſcends it, may. What is above our Capacities, may be true, and from God, though what is contrary unto our Reaſon, is not true, nor can be from God.</p>
            <p>On this Diſtinction I do the rather inſiſt, as well to obviate what is ſuggeſted by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and others, who receive for Articles of their Faith, what is contrary unto right Reaſon, as to anticipate the <hi>Socinians</hi> Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, who will believe nothing that tranſcends our ſcanty and narrow Capacities.</p>
            <p>That this may be the more plain and convincing, before I proceed to ſhew what are ſome of thoſe Myſterious Doctrines which tranſcend our Intellects, I will acquaint the Reader with ſome Notions received by many, which being contrary unto our cleareſt and ſureſt Reaſonings, are not to be <hi>improved,</hi> but rejected.</p>
            <p>I'll mention but ſome. 1. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> 2. <hi>Merit, quod Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam commutativam.</hi> And 3. A <hi>Phyſical tranſition of Sins actually inherent in us, from us unto Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto us.</hi> All which are to be rejected as Notions <hi>contrary</hi> to our Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:42587:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>I. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> A Doctrine aſſerted by the Papiſts to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Holy Writ, but really not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is meant the turning of the Elements in the Lords Supper into the very Subſtance of Chriſt's Body. Though the Accidents which are proper unto Bread and Wine, diſtinguiſhing them from every other Being, be there, yet the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, the only Subject of the proper Accidents, is not there.</p>
            <p>That is, 1. The <hi>Proper</hi> Accidents of Bread and Wine are <hi>Common</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Subjects, and a Humane Body; which is a Contradiction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Accidents, namely, the Colour and Taſte of Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe whole Exiſtence is Inexiſtence in a Subject, do exiſt even when they do not inexiſt, namely, when they paſs from the Bread unto Chriſt's Body.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Body of Chriſt is aſſerted to be bodily under theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, even when there is not any one Accident proper unto an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many other Contradictions muſt be received as true, if you will with the Papiſts put the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation into your Creed. But as this Conceit of theirs has not the leaſt countenance of Scripture, ſo 'tis contrary unto our Reaſon, as well as Common Sence, and to be rejected as unſound and falſe, as well as abſurd and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Merit quoad Juſtitiam commutativam.</hi> There are among the Papiſts a conſiderable number, who aſſert that there may be a meriting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God according to the Rules of <hi>Commutative Juſtice.</hi> That there may be a meriting ſomewhat of God according to the Rule of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> we grant; for Jeſus Chriſt merited much of God, but this Merit was not according to the Rule of <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> but of <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice.</hi> Merit as to <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> does neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it the paſſing of ſomewhat over unto God, unto which God had no Right antecedent unto this Tranſaction: But God is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lord and Sovereign, who has a Right unto all things; Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as Man, is Gods Propriety, and all that Jeſus Chriſt could give, muſt be conſidered as Chriſt's, either as he is God, or as he is Man. Whatever belongs to him as God, is God's; and as he is Man, whatever he has, 'tis God's: for which Reaſon, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is not excepted, when 'tis ſaid by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Who has firſt given unto him, and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again?</hi> Who? As if it had been ſaid, There is none, no not one, not Jeſus Chriſt himſelf could give firſt unto God, could give that unto God, unto which God had not, antecedently to that Gift, a Right, that is, ſo to give unto God, as to paſs over a new Right unto God, for which God ſhould be under the Obligation of recompenſing it. Commutative Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is inconſiſtent with the abſolute Sovereignty and Dominion of God; whence it muſt be acknowledged, that either God is not the abſolute Sovereign and Lord of the Univerſe, which, if not, he is not God; or
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:42587:219" rendition="simple:additions"/> there is no ſuch thing as Commutative Righteouſneſs in God, and that Chriſt himſelf, much leſs Man, could not merit of God any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Commutative Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt merited according to <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice,</hi> is aſſerted by all ſound Proteſtants, and by <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and other Papiſts; yea, and that <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, according to the tenor of that Law there given him, might by rendring the required perfect Obedience, have merited the promiſed Reward, <hi>i. e.</hi> the merit would have been of ſuch efficacy, that God could not have remained juſt, and not have given out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Life, is alſo granted.</p>
            <p>But a Merit as to Commutative Juſtice, contains in it an Implication, when ſpoken of God; for in plain Engliſh 'tis to ſay, That the Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereign is not Abſolute Sovereign: However this Notion is embraced by ſome Papiſts, who do not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y, That Commutative Juſtice is in God, but that according to the Rule of Commutative Juſtice man may merit of God: the which is the more abſurd, as it ſuppoſes that man can give that unto God, which is of a value propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to Eternal Life, although Eternal Life, as 'tis to endure infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, includes in it ſomewhat of an infinite Excellency; ſuch is the Nature of Commutative Juſtice as to ſtick to an <hi>Arithmetical</hi> proportion, in adjuſting the Value of things commuted, which cannot be by man in this caſe, unleſs there were ſomewhat of Infinity in what he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. However, notwithſtanding the ridiculouſneſs, as well as falſeneſs of the Notion, there are many among the Papiſts (if we may believe <hi>Arriaga</hi>) who aſſert it. 'Tis true <hi>Vaſquez</hi> explodes it, with an Eſſay to evince that the Papiſts generally reject it; but <hi>Arriaga,</hi> a later Jeſuit, freely rebukes <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> affirming that commutative righteouſneſs is in God, and may be found to be between God and man, and that this is generally received in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſays he, This is the Opinion of <hi>Suarez, Valentia, Granadus</hi> (who introduces <hi>Medina,</hi> and <hi>Alvarez,</hi> to agree with him in this Point) <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza, Raguſa, Tannerus,</hi> and <hi>Albertinus,</hi> and <hi>Molina</hi> alſo; who, though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf with Caution in one place, yet elſewhere doth freely enough own it; beſides <hi>Capreolus</hi> and the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> generally (ſays <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aga</hi>) do agree with him in this; and that therefore <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is greatly to be blamed for affirming, that ſo many were of the contrary Opinion, whereas this about Merit <hi>quoad Juſtitiam commutativam,</hi> has many more Authorities than <hi>Vaſquez</hi> could produce for his Sence of it. In fine, <hi>Arriaga</hi> corrects <hi>Vaſquez</hi>'s Miſtake, in ſaying that <hi>Hoſius</hi> and <hi>Sotus</hi> were againſt Commutative Righteouſneſs, and then proceeds to an Attempt of demonſtrating the Truth of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>By this 'tis apparent, That if we may believe <hi>Arriago,</hi> the Papiſts generally aſſert Merit according to Commutative Juſtice; in which Sence 'tis moſtly oppugned by the Proteſtant Writers, as a ridiculous
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:42587:219" rendition="simple:additions"/> Doctrine. The which, from what has been already ſuggeſted, has been manifeſted. But ſeeing this Doctrine contradicts our Reaſon, our Endeavours muſt not be <hi>how</hi> to improve it, we muſt immediately reject it as falſe and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p n="3">III. There are ſome who call themſelves Proteſtants, and who ſeem to be zealous Aſſerters of <hi>Imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> who being ignorant of the Goſpel-Notion, do aſſert, <hi>That thoſe very Sins which actually inhered in the Elect, did paſs from them unto Chriſt, and that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which actually inhered in him, paſſes from him unto the Elect.</hi> But this is a Notion as contrary unto our Reaſons as that of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> it being as impoſſible that Our Sins, or Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which are Accidents Inhering in Subjects, ſhould paſs from Us to Chriſt, or from Chriſt to Us, as the Accidents of Bread and Wine ſhould paſs from the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, and inhere in Chriſt's Body. Theſe Notions then I reject as Falſe, and <hi>Contrary</hi> unto Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But there are other Doctrines reveal'd in Scripture, which tranſcend our largeſt capacities. There are (I muſt acknowledg) many momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and important points, which though clearly enough reveal'd, and in themſelves not very hard to be underſtood, yet becauſe either obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or after a perplexed manner handled, by ſome are liſted among the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes ſome mention, which by the unlearned are abuſed to their own hurt, even when by the more judicious they are clearly underſtood and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eadily embrac'd. However 'tis as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there are other Doctrines, which bearing the Characters of infinite Wiſdom on 'em, are ſo grand and auguſt, that they tranſcend the moſt enlarged Underſtandings. Of the Truth of theſe Doctrines, we may be fully aſſured; but yet cannot fully comprehend the whole of 'em: we may know enough to raiſe our admiration; but cannot frame any adequate conceptions of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> are many, and may be diſtinctly conſidered, either as they have reference more immediately unto the Nature and Being of God, his Acts, both immanent and tranſient, and conſequently, the modes of Operation; or as they have a ſpecial aſpect on thoſe profound and myſterious Tranſactions about the carrying on fall'n mans Salvation in a way adjuſted to the Glory of all the Divine Perfections.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>many</hi> Doctrines <hi>which more immediately reſpect the Nature of God,</hi> his Acts and Modes of Operation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally, they are all ſuch as repreſent ſomewhat of him, who in all Perfections is infinite, and infinitely above us; God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, infinite, infinite in his Eſſence, or immenſe, infinite in his exiſtence, or external. There is according to the Conceptions we muſt form of God (at leaſt <hi>quoad nos</hi>) a difference between Immenſity and Externity. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42587:220" rendition="simple:additions"/> denotes the Eſſence of God to be more large and comprehenſive than can be meaſured, but the import of Eternity is to be conſidered with regard to the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Divine Eſſence; whence although we muſt aſſert the Eſſence, and Exiſtence of God to be ſo much the ſame, that neceſſary Exiſtence is included in the very Eſſence of God, yet we may look on the divine Exiſtence to be a <hi>preſſior conceptus</hi> to that of the divine Eſſence; for eſſence includes ſomewhat more than meer exiſtence namely other perfections of the divine Nature, which when conſidered, as it fills Heaven and Earth, and is infinitely beyond all, without all bounds or limits, 'tis ſaid, to be immenſe; but conſidered as enduring from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting to everlaſting 'tis Eternal. The like of the other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
            <p>Thus our finite capacities may form ſome partial and inadequate Conceptions of theſe things, but comprehend them we cannot: If we look into any particular Attribute of God, we are ſwallowed up as in a bottomleſs Ocean. For there is not any one Divine Perfection that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not in it Infinity, the which is ſo far above us, that we cannot reach unto it: We cannot know him unto Perfection, nor by ſearching find him out. He is higher than the Heavens, deeper than Hell, longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea, we cannot comprehend him; His Nature; his Attributes, all his glorious Perfections being infinite, are infinitely above us, and ſeeing the Revelations made of God do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort repreſent ſomewhat of his glorious Nature, they are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehended by us: They point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto ſomewhat that is beyond us. But to be more particular,</p>
            <p n="2">2. God, who is a <hi>Spirit Infinite,</hi> is abſolutely and ſimply <hi>One,</hi> he is a pure Act, but yet <hi>Three,</hi> One abſolutely and ſimply, One God and yet Three, <hi>Three Perſons.</hi> None can be more concerned in aſſerting the Oneneſs or Unity of the Godhead than the Chriſtian; how vehement ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Mahometane, Jew</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> may be in aſſerting the Simplicity and Oweneſs of the Divine Nature, they cannot be more ſo than We are, but yet a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Perſons in the Godhead we muſt alſo affirm, or our Religion is loſt.</p>
            <p>Whoever will but ſeriouſly acquaint himſelf with the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion will find that the believing a Trinity is as neceſſary to the being of our Religion, as the believing the exiſtence of God is to any Religion. The Spirit of God has not only here and there expreſly aſſerted the Doctrine of the Trinity, but every momentous Doctrine of our Religion, which is appropriate unto it, <hi>as 'tis Chriſtian,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it.</p>
            <p>There are Three Fundamentals of our Faith, all which conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, ſuppoſe a Trinity of Perſons in the Godhead, even God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt. There is the <hi>Fall</hi>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:42587:220" rendition="simple:additions"/> of <hi>Man,</hi> his <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Sanctification.</hi> God at firſt made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and gave him a Holy, Juſt and Good Law, which was ſanction'd with the Promiſe of a glorious Reward, and with the ſevere Threat of Divine Wrath and Indignation, <hi>Do this and Live,</hi> but <hi>in the Day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die.</hi> Man tranſgreſſes this Law, and is obnoxious unto the Threatning, he muſt die: For God who is Infinite in all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a God of Truth, and muſt accompliſh his Word. He is <hi>eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> and muſt proportion the puniſhment to the nature of the Crime. An Infinite God is offended, his Law is violated, and this by Man, by <hi>Adam</hi> the Head of Human Nature, and therefore 'tis impoſſible that any eſcape Infinite (which is on finite Worms Eternal) Wrath, unleſs the Juſtice of God be ſatisfyed by proportionable Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in that nature that ſinned. But if there had been but One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as there is but One God, there could not be an Infinite Perſon to undertake for us. That one Perſon who was offended would be alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfie his own Juſtice, but he is angry, he demands ſatisfaction from another; and ſhould he enter into judgment with us, we ſhould not be able to ſtand.</p>
            <p>He demands ſatisfaction, and is ready to conſume us, unleſs an Infi-Perſon interpoſes on our behalf; ſhould he himſelf begin to capitulate with us ſingly, he would be ſo far from offering himſelf to ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, that he would immediately let out all his wrath.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that the Doctrines about mans Fall and Redemption, do neceſſarily infer that there is <hi>God the Father,</hi> who gave us a righteous Law, and who is highly provoked by the violation of it, and as a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge proceeds to condemn us, unleſs ſatisfaction be made unto his Juſtice; and that there being <hi>God the Son,</hi> a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, who is alſo God, ſent by the Father, and who aſſumed Humane Nature, in which he ſuffered, and ſatisfied the Juſtice of the Father, whereby fallen man is in a way of recovery; thus mans Fall and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery ſuppoſe two Perſons. But whoever will more cloſely attend unto this Point, will find that God being as Holy as he is Juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, is as much concern'd for the Vindication of the Honour of his Holineſs, as that of his Juſtice, whence our Sanctification becomes as neceſſary an Antecedent unto our Salvation, as our Juſtification. Though Juſtification and Sanctification are in their own natures formally and really diſtinct, yet are ever in one and the ſame Subject: You may and muſt diſtinguiſh them from each other, but cannot ſeparate them. And the Reaſon is, becauſe God is as Holy as he is Righteous, and as much concern'd for the Glory of his Holineſs, as for the Glory of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And therefore the Holy as well as the Righteous Will of God muſt be ſatisfied: But ſuch are the Corruptions of our Nature, ſo ſtrong and powerful, and we ſo weak and feeble, that unleſs ſome one <hi>Almighty</hi> be our help, we ſhall remain under the power of Sin, unſanctified, and no way advantaged by the Redemption of Chriſt's Death.</p>
            <pb n="498" facs="tcp:42587:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>'Tis true, Chriſt has died, but not to ſave us in, but from our ſins. It was never the Deſign of Chriſt that men ſhould receive any ſpecial Bleſſings as the fruit of his Death, while they continue under the power of Sin, Enemies unto him. He has made a purchaſe of Heavens Glories, but will give it to none but ſuch as ſubmit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. He will that we humble our ſelves before him, and be holy, or continue in the ſtate of Condemnation, in which we are all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Holy we cannot be without the help of an <hi>Omnipotent Spirit,</hi> which only is able to enlighten our Minds, and turn our Hearts from the power of Satan unto God: All which ſuppoſes the <hi>Third Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this 'tis very manifeſt, that ſuch is the frame of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch the great Fundamentals thereof, that without the ſuppoſing the Truth of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of Perſons in the Godhead, the Chriſtian Religion is gone, 'tis loſt. And how to comprehend this <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtery</hi> is impoſſible. There is no contradiction in this Doctrine, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng in it contrary to our Reaſon; for 'tis not ſaid, that <hi>Three Gods</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> but <hi>Three Perſons</hi> are <hi>One, One God.</hi> But how to fathom the Myſtery, we are at a loſs, 'tis certainly beyond Us.</p>
            <p>So much concerning the Nature and Perſons of the Godhead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Doctrines that have regard unto the <hi>ACTS of God,</hi> are alſo very profound and myſterious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are the <hi>Immanent Acts</hi> of God, which do not terminate on any Objects <hi>ad extra,</hi> off from God, ſuch as Divine Knowledge, and the Decree, whether of Election or Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Tranſient Acts,</hi> ſuch as terminate on an Object off from God, namely, the Works of Creation and Providence.</p>
            <p>In my diſcourſing about the Immanent Acts of God, I might be very diſtinct in conſidering what is very much inſiſted on by the <hi>School-men,</hi> with reference to the Knowledge of God, and acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the many Diſtinctions that are uſed by that ſort of men but if I do ſo, I ſhall exceed the Bounds allotted me: I will therefore paſs by the Doctrine of <hi>Praeſcience</hi> [which (whatever may be ſaid of it by ſome) has ſuch difficulties in it, as admit not of our Solution,] and make ſome ſearch into theſe profound Doctrines about the Decrees of Election and Reprobation.</p>
            <p>That God has decreed the Salvation of ſome particular Perſons, is evident enough to any that will deliberately conſult the Word of God, and that 'tis the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable Determination of God,</hi> That ſuch as die
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:42587:221" rendition="simple:additions"/> in their Sins, ſhall be eternally damned, is as manifeſt. The Eternal Decree of Election is ſo clearly, ſo fully, and diſtinctly reveal'd in Scripture, that few or none preſume wholly to deny it; and ſuch is the known Nature of Election, that 'tis not eaſie to believe the Doctrine of Election, but withal we muſt take in the other of Reprobation; for Election is but of <hi>ſome,</hi> and if but ſome are taken, the other are left; they are not choſen, they are refuſed, they are reprobated. But how this Doctrine of Gods leaving, or reprobating any from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is reconcileable to theſe other that concern the Glory of Divine Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, is above us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> have done very much towards the clearing up of this, by ſuppoſing all in their lapſed eſtate, under the guilt and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, and God from all Eternity concern'd for his own Glory, to Elect ſome, who by being intereſted in the Blood of Chriſt, ſhould through the ſanctification of the Spirit obtain Salvation with eternal Glory; but left others to themſelves, who continuing in Sin, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to die. Hereby the glorious Grace of God in the eternal purpoſe of Calling, Juſtifying, Sanctifying ſome, and thereby prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them for Heaven, is excellently diſplayed, and the purpoſing from Eternity to leave others to themſelves in their Sins, for which, after much long-ſuffering, they ſhall be eternally damned, is no way incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that goodneſs that is ſo infinitely extended to the Veſſels of Mercy, but does moſt fully illuſtrate how juſt and righteous God is in condemning them for their Sins and Tranſgreſſions. Beſides, 'tis obvious enough that the Decrees are but internal Purpoſes which have no influence on the thing decreed. <hi>Decreta nil ponunt in Eſſe.</hi> Though there is a certainty of the Event, yet neither the Sin, nor Deſtruction of the Reprobate is an Effect of the Decree.</p>
            <p>What is here ſaid towards the clearing up the Difficulties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Doctrine, is very well urged by the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> and 'tis no more than what has great countenance from the Holy Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſuppoſe all in a laps'd and fallen Eſtate, and therefore repreſents the Elect as Choſen <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. and Predeſtinated unto the Adoption of Children <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Elect according to the Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God the Father through <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. All which Expreſſions ſeem to ſuppoſe the Elect in a fallen eſtate, ſtanding in need both of a Redeemer and Sanctifier; even as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are ſaid, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. to have been before of Old ordained unto <hi>Condemnation;</hi> which <hi>Condemnation</hi> does preſuppoſe a Judicial Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and the Sentence paſt againſt them for their Sin, which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuggeſts that they were conſidered to have been in a ſinful, a fallen ſtate. Nevertheleſs it muſt be acknowledged, That this does not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> the difficulty, it only <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> it to be inſuperable, and therefore to be paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <pb n="500" facs="tcp:42587:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The great Difficulty is, <hi>How the Abſolute Decree of Reprobation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent either with the Goodneſs or Righteouſneſs of God, or thoſe other Methods which are taken for the ſalvation of all men?</hi> What of Goodneſs is there in deſtinating men to eternal Miſery? or what of Juſtice in purpoſing to puniſh them for ever without any regard to their Sin, even before any evil done? or how can the unalterable ſecret Decree for their damnation accord with the ſincerity of God in the many Offers which are made of future Glory? 'Tis true; ſuppoſing the conſideration of their faln ſtate as antecedent to the Decree, 'tis goodneſs enough that any are choſen out of the ſinful Maſs, and it would have been a righteous thing for God to have proceeded againſt all to a Sentence of Condemnation: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt has died, and thereby ſatisfied Juſtice, and the Spirit ſtrives, and that common Grace which is ſufficient to enable men to do more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Salvation than they do, is offered them, and that 'tis their Sin which is the only proper cauſe of their denying due Subjection unto Chriſt, theſe things ſeem to be cleared up; only the greateſt difficulty remains, to wit, How 'tis ſuppoſeable that ſuch who came pure out of the hand of God, can be conſidered as fallen, without ſome reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the anteceding Decree of God. What! is their Fall, on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of which depends all the Diſcoveries of the glorious Perfections of God made unto us in the Scriptures, a meer caſual hit? One would aſſoon think, that this curious and beautiful Fabrick the World was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only unto the caſual concourſe of <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atoms for its being ſo, as that the Glory and Beauty, the Wiſdom and Harmony that ſhines forth moſt illuſtriouſly in the Chriſtian Religion, ſhould be only the product of Caſualty or Chance; but if the Fall or Sin of man muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be decreed by that God, the Purity and Holineſs of whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infinite, we are as much at a plunge; ſo that on the whole, we ſee in the Decree of Reprobation ſomewhat Myſterious and Profound; there is in this Doctrine ſomewhat that may raiſe our greateſt admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but can never be by vain Mortals comprehended; for what of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in deſtinating thoſe who were in a ſtate of Holineſs and Innocency, unto Sin and Guilt? or what of Righteouſneſs in the giving the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a Law, and making them contrary to their innate holy propenſions, Tranſgreſſors of that Law? or how does the Sincerity of God appear in the offers of Eternal Life to <hi>Adam</hi> on his Obedience, even when his Diſobedience was determined and inevitable? This ſhews that there is ſomewhat above us in this Doctrine, and that although there is nothing in this Point contradictory, nor contrary to our Reaſons, yet there is in it ſomewhat that tranſcends it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Doctrine about the <hi>Tranſient Acts</hi> of God, whereby the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of the Decree is compaſſed, falls next under conſideration. The Decree, which is but an <hi>Immanent Act</hi> in God, does not put the thing decreed into Being, that is done long after by ſome <hi>Tranſient Acts.</hi> The Decree is from Eternity, the Execution only in <hi>Time.</hi> The Decree is but an internal purpoſe about what God <hi>will</hi> do in time, which Decree
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:42587:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the time appointed being executed, the thing decreed is then put into Being; the which cannot be done without the Phyſical Influence of God.</p>
            <p>This is true of every Decree, whether that of the Worlds Creation, its being deſtroyed by the Flood, or by the laſt Conflagration. The Decree of all this was eternal, but the Execution in time. The World is firſt created, then after ſome hundred years the Deluge, and although ſome thouſand years have paſt, yet not burnt. The ſame of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that ſome ſhall be glorified, which does neceſſarily preſuppoſe that they muſt be firſt in Being, before the Decree of their Glorification can be accompliſhed. 'Tis naturally impoſſible that what is not actually in being, ſhould be actually the Subject of Glory or any thing elſe. Moreover, if we will believe what the Spirit ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. they muſt be <hi>firſt</hi> effectually called, and then juſtified, and ſo through the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit be prepared for the Glory. There is an Order to be found in the Execution of the Decree, which is but according to the eternal Counſels of the Divine Will.</p>
            <p>An Illuſtration of this we have in <hi>Man,</hi> who may purpoſe to do many things in time; his internal purpoſe to do the thing may be long before the time appointed, and there is an Order to be obſerved in his purpoſes, he purpoſes that one thing ſhall be firſt done, and after that another, as is beſt diſcovered by what he does. The which being ſo, we cannot argue that ſuch a man purpoſing to give his Child an Eſtate when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives unto the Age of one and twenty, that therefore 'twas actually given ſome years before: the like as to the point of Election; God determined the Juſtification, Sanctification and Glory of ſome; Gods purpoſe was from eternity, but he did then but purpoſe that this ſhould be in time, and that Sanctification ſhould as neceſſarily precede the Glory, as Juſtification be <hi>ordine Naturae</hi> before his Sanctification; and therefore 'tis abſurd to argue, God decreed their Juſtification from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, therefore they were juſtified from Eternity; God decreed that they ſhould be firſt called, and then juſtified, and therefore as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification muſt be before Glory, and Juſtification before Sanctification, even ſo Effectual Vocation muſt be before their being juſtified; ſo that although <hi>Paul</hi> be an elect Veſſel, yet he is not actually juſtified before he is effectually called.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are plain <hi>Truths,</hi> but yet how to comprehend the ways of God in bringing theſe things to paſs, is beyond our Capacity; and that this is ſo, I will evince.</p>
            <p>Among the Learned there are great Conteſts about the <hi>Modes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operation.</hi> All grant that the Decrees would have remain'd unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, had not God by ſome <hi>Tranſient Acts</hi> put the Decree in being; and that this muſt be conſidered to be done by ſome <hi>Phyſical Efficiency</hi> of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:42587:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, is acknowledged by all. 'Tis true, the ſhewing <hi>How</hi> this <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Efficiency</hi> doth contribute toward the execution of the Decree, is difficult, eſpecially as to the cauſing ſuch Acts as are clothed with vicious modifications, where what is Phyſical in that Action is acknowledged to be from the Efficiency of God; but whether the Divine Efficience be <hi>Mediate</hi> or <hi>Immediate,</hi> is controverted between the <hi>Durandiſts</hi> on the one part, and all the reſt of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> generally on the other; but if <hi>Immediate,</hi> whether <hi>antecedenter, concomitanter,</hi> or <hi>conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>quenter,</hi> is warmly debated by the rigid <hi>Dominicans, Scotiſts,</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> each of theſe three Factions differing from each other, and caſting in one anothers way inſoluble Difficulties.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the moderate <hi>Dominican,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Medina, Dominicus à Soto,</hi> and ſome others do in my Opinion, give the beſt ſatisfaction in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Controverſies; for they aſſert, That we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is <hi>Natural,</hi> and what is <hi>Moral</hi> in a ſinful Action, and that the ſubject Matter of the Vitioſity of a ſinful Action is ſomewhat Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that all the undue Modifications of it are Moral, and included in the Formality, whence they proceed to conclude, That what is meerly natural in a ſinful Action, is from God; a Notion no one will deny; but what is Moral and Vicious in it, or that Undueneſs that is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſinful Relation (conſidering Sin with reference to the Law, whereof 'tis a Tranſgreſſion) is from Man.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be clear enough, only there ſtill remains ſomewhat inſoluble; for whoever looks well into this Controverſie, will find that in the ſinfulneſs of ſome Actions there is ſomewhat <hi>Poſitive;</hi> what elſe is the Converſion or Termination of a Natural Act on an undue Object, or the undue Determination of this Act on a due Object? It muſt be acknowledged, That Sin does not only reſult when the Act is about an undue Object, but alſo when about a due Object, if unduly converſant about it, <hi>e. g.</hi> In the Hatred of God, the Object of this Act is undue; but as for inordinate Love to Father or Mother, the Object of Love in this Caſe is not undue, but from the <hi>Intenſion</hi> of the Act doth the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs reſult; which Intenſion is ſomewhat Poſitive: but whether it muſt be conſidered as ſomewhat Natural, or as ſomewhat meerly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Mixt, partly Natural and partly Moral, is beyond me; but if not meerly Moral, it muſt be from God, and ſo God muſt be either the Author of Sin, or the foundation of this Relation muſt not be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be included in the Formality of Sin, that is, the intenſion of the Act, though inordinate and undue, is not ſinful. By which it is manifeſt that if we conſider the Controverſie, there is ſomewhat above us in the faireſt ſtating it, much more ſo in the other Accounts that are given; for as the rigid <hi>Dominicans</hi> do certainly make God the Cauſe of Sin, (whether culpable or not culpable, is not the Queſtion) even ſo do the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts;</hi> for they both include in the matter of Sin ſomewhat more than what is meerly Natural, even ſomewhat that is
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:42587:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> morally Vicious, and yet aſſert that this Matter is the immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods Cauſality, only the one ſays, That God does as it were take man by the hand, and lead him to Sin; the other, That man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the Efficiency of God; and the <hi>Scotiſt</hi> ſays, That the firſt and ſecond Cauſe do walk hand in hand to the Sin, but whether I lead another to the Sin, and help him to commit it; or whether I am taken by the Sinner, and determined to help him to produce what is ſinful in the Act, or whether I walk with him ſtil, I am at leaſt a Concauſer of what is ſinful in the Act; ſo that neither the <hi>Scotiſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Moliniſt</hi> give me any ſatisfaction in this Matter. The Reſult therefore of my thoughts is as follows, I am ſure that no Natural Being ever has been, is, or can be without the Efficiency of God the firſt Cauſe, and yet I am as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that no Moral Evil is in any ſenſe the Effect of the Phyſical Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God: The Moral Undueneſs that is conſidered as that which is the Foundation of Sin, cannot be from God, but yet how ſatisfactorily to reconcile theſe things, or how to comprehend the Modes of Divine Operation, is above us, we cannot reach unto it, it tranſcends our Underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There are alſo ſeveral Doctrines, which have a ſpecial Aſpect on thoſe Tranſactions that are about the carrying on Fall'n Mans Salvation to the Illuſtrating the Glory of the divine Perfections, which are very profound.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of the Fall of Man; the Tranſition of Original Sin from <hi>Adam</hi> to his Poſterity; the Methods taken for the Recovery of the Elect; the Covenant of Reconciliation between the Father and the Son, from all Eternity; the Incarnation of the Son of God; and the many ſurprizing Doctrines with reference thereunto, even about his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices as Mediator; and in ſpecial That of his Being a Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of <hi>Melchiſedek;</hi> his Suretyſhip; how our Sins were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; and his Righteouſneſs made ours, beſide thoſe Doctrines about the Nature of the <hi>Mystical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that is between Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and how this is the ground of Imputation; and many other momentous points might be ſpoken unto, to evince, That though there is nothing of Contradiction in theſe Doctrines, yet there is very much that tranſcends the moſt enlarged Capacity. They are points that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves are prying into, but cannot fully comprehend. But theſe things I muſt wave and go on to acquaint you with ſome of the many <hi>Providences,</hi> that do in like manner tranſcend our Underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Among the many amuzing Providences that are before Us, I will ſingle out a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>greateſt part of the World ſhould lye in Wickedneſs, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Methods of Salvation is an amuzing Providence.</hi> Look we into the remoteſt parts of the World, we find nothing but a ſtrange
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:42587:224" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ignorance of the true God, or of the true Worſhip of God; Oh how great a part of the World is over-run with Paganiſm, Mahometaniſm, and Judaiſm; Come we nearer home and take a view of the Chriſtian World; behold, how ſmall is it in compariſon of thoſe parts, where the abovemention'd falſe Religions prevail, and of the many thouſands, who are called Chriſtians; how many Invelop'd with the thick clouds of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Error? and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew free from the Influence of Idolatry and Superſtition? A multitude of thoſe who have been baptiz'd into the name of Chriſt, have not the opportunity of looking into the ſacred Oracles, which reveal the true way to Life everlaſting, and of thoſe who have the happy Advantages of conſulting the ſacred Scriptures, how few can underſtand them? The which is not without a Providence of God; But can we compare theſe Providences with thoſe diſcoveries, that are made of the Infinite Compaſſions of Almighty God towards the Children of men, and comprehend a conſiſtency between them?</p>
            <p>In the Scriptures 'tis ſaid, That God would have all men be ſaved, and to that end come to the Knowledg of the Truth, even when but a very ſmall ſpot of the Earth have any ſuitable means afforded 'em for the obtaining ſuch knowledg. In the Scriptures the Proclamation is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all, Ho, every one; and the Expoſtulation with Sinners is, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye dye? as I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a Sinner,</hi> of a Sinner indefinitely; <hi>q. d.</hi> of any Sinner, but rather, <hi>That he would Turn, and Live.</hi> Beſides, did not Chriſt die for this end; namely, to ſhew the unexpreſſible greatneſs of Gods Love to the world? <hi>God ſo loved,</hi> ſo, ſo <hi>loved the World;</hi> as if it had been ſaid, the Love of God to the World is ſo tranſcendent that no words could ſufficiently expreſs it, nothing would fully repreſent it, but the Delivery of the Son, the only begotten Son of God to the Death, the cruel, the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the reproachful Death of the Croſs, for the ſalvation of the World, on their Believing, and this even when God left Millions of Angels to continue in everlaſting Chains of Darkneſs; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which, it is manifeſt, That they cannot believe in him of whom they have not heard, and cannot hear unleſs a Preacher be ſent unto them, and that no ſuch thing has been done, no Preacher has been ſent, or if in one Age, yet not in another. How can we reconcile theſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences with the Diſcoveries that are given us of the infinite Compaſſions of God to Mankind, when ſo few are made partakers of it? What of Grace is there in leaving the greateſt part of the World in a very little better condition than the fallen Angels?</p>
            <p>I know that there are many things offered towards the ſatisfaction of a thoughtful Perſon; as, Who can tell but there are thouſand of Worlds above us, whoſe Inhabitants are in a better capacity to receive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Inſtances of Divine Love, and that this world is but a Spot in compariſon of them, and if this whole World ſhould periſh, 'tis but as the hanging up a few Malefactors, to ſhew that God is juſt as well as
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:42587:224" rendition="simple:additions"/> merciful; but how does this ſolve the Difficulty which is not meerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Notion we have of Gods me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ciful Nature in it ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but from the Revelations made thereof unto the Children of men in the Scripture; about which we cannot have any ſolid ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but from things which are obvious before us, not from what is ſo fully out of our view and knowledge, and concerning Creatures of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, there are ſome intimations in the Sacred Scriptures, which apart, and by themſelves conſidered, afford Relief; ſuch as theſe, <hi>The Gentiles which have not the written Law, doing the things contained in the Law, are a Law unto themſelves;</hi> by which Law they ſhall at the laſt be judged, but not by the written Law, and who walking according to this Law, will find their Conſciences to excuſe them, as the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof ſhall be under the Accuſations of Conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15. Beſides, it is ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, that the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Divine Vengeance was againſt them, was not ſo much becauſe they <hi>knew not God,</hi> or were unacquainted with the Methods of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe when the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who had [not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> for their guide, but] only the Light of Nature, the things made for their help, <hi>glorified not God as God, but were unthankful, and became vain in their Imaginations.</hi> And to theſe Conſiderations, if we add what <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. has, it ſeems as if many of the Gentiles, who were ſtrangers to the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſaved; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him;</hi> every one that walketh according to that <hi>Light</hi> he has received, ſhall be ſaved. If this be minded without a fixing our thoughts on other Scriptural Conſiderations, the difficulty would be removed; but when we reflect on the many other Texts that aſſert Chriſt Jeſus to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Door to Glory, and that <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can be ſaved but that of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and the Reaſon of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, namely, <hi>That all have ſinned, and have fallen ſhort of the Glory of God;</hi> that ſuch is the eſſential Righteouſneſs of God as engageth him to demand Satisfaction, and that unleſs his Juſtice be ſatisfied, no Salvation can be had, and that there is none other able to ſatisfie the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, but Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, and that all who are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Merits, muſt ſubmit unto him; I ſay, whoever will conſider the foregoing Paſſages with theſe, will find himſelf ſtill at a loſs; ſo that on the whole, I am brought to this Reſult, that is, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Spirit of God doth ſo very much inſiſt on the largeneſs of Divine Love to the World, the leaſt part thereof are made partakers of it, unleſs Salvation is to be had out of Chriſt, or unleſs a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith be ſufficient to entitle the Heathen unto any of thoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Bleſſings that are the purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood; but when we come ſo far, if we do but intentely mind theſe things, we ſhall find our ſelves in the dark; and though we have the greateſt reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:42587:225" rendition="simple:additions"/> That theſe things are reconcileable, yet muſt we acknowledge that they are above us, they are too high, we cannot attain unto the height thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch whoſe Lot hath been caſt into more pleaſant places, and who have had the advantageous Helps of Sacred Scripture for their direction in the way of Life, have yet been by Providence plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into many an inextricable Labyrinths of Difficulties, is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> who can without ſurprize converſe with the Diſputes there are among the Learned about the <hi>Hebrew Copy</hi> we now have; or the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> as whether the former or the latter is more Authentick, and muſt be taken for the Canon? There are ſome momentous differences between them, and therefore 'tis our Concern to enquire after that which is to be our <hi>Rule;</hi> if it be the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> we are at a loſs about its Riſe; for it is well known that the <hi>Greek</hi> is not that Language which the Holy Ghoſt uſed with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> 'tis but a Tranſlation, but where is the Original? Beſide, whatever is ſaid by ſome of the Fathers concerning the miraculous Agreement of the 72 <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> as Tranſlaters of the Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis manifeſt enough out of <hi>Ariſtaeus</hi> (of whom the Learned <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> has writ ſo much) that they only Tranſlated the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and no more: Neither is it very difficult to ſhew that the LXX we now have, is more Novel than that of the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Hebrew</hi> muſt be taken for the Canon, yet as to the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome are at a loſs whether the <hi>Samaritan</hi> or the <hi>Hebrew</hi> be moſt <hi>Authentick?</hi> But whether the one or the other, 'tis ſtill que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried whether we have the <hi>Autograph?</hi> Yet we are ſtill in a Labyrinth, not only about the various Readings, the <hi>Keri</hi> and the <hi>Chetir,</hi> but about the Antiquity of the Points, whether they are Coaeval with the Letters or not?

            <p>But might theſe Difficulties be removed, yet as to the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of profeſſed Chriſtians, there are others, which to them are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable; for they underſtand not the Original, and have for their Guidance and Conduct no other help but what either ſome ignorant or prophane Prieſt affords them. Such is the Neglect the greateſt part of Chriſtendom is guilty of, that where there is <hi>one</hi> learned and pious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to direct, there are <hi>two,</hi> who are either very ignorant or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for which reaſon the greateſt part of the People, who are under the Miniſters Conduct, are either to receive help from the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> who cannot relieve them; or from the <hi>Scandalous,</hi> who cannot be confided in: How can the People put any Truſt in the <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of ſuch who are ſtrangers to nothing more than to ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues?</p>
            <p>There is very much may be ſaid to ſolve theſe <hi>Phaenomena;</hi> but yet when all that can be offered has been inſiſted on, we ſhall find ſomewhat in the Providence that doth tranſcend our Underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I will mention only one Providence more that does greatly amuſe and aſtoniſh many that do truly fear the Lord, and that is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Although it be frequently aſſerted in Scripture, That to the Godly, the Promiſe of the good things of this Life, as well as of that to come, is given, yet we find the godly to be without them, even when the wicked, who know not God, do abound; <hi>Many are the Afflictions and Tribulations of the Righteous,</hi> Job 21.7, &amp;c. <hi>They are hated, reproached, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, but the wicked they live, become old, and are mighty in Power, their Seed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight with them, and their Off-ſpring before their Eyes, their Houſes are ſafe from fear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Rod of God upon them, they are not in trouble as other men;</hi> namely, as the Godly; <hi>neither are they plagued like them.</hi> Surely there be ſome juſt men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men unto whom it happeneth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the work of the Righteous. All which does plainly ſhew, that no man can find out the work that is done under the Sun; though a wiſe man ſeek to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to find it; though there may be ſome ſeeming Solutions given, yet ſtill ſomewhat will appear inſoluble, and to tranſcend our Underſtandings.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn particularly, That there are ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Providences</hi> which tranſcend our Underſtandings <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they are ſo deep and profound, ſo high and much above Us, that we may all with the Apoſtle cry out, <hi>O the depths of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> I ſay, having ſhewn thus much, I will now proceed to ſhew, <hi>How we may Graciouſly improve theſe Doctrines and Providences.</hi> In doing which, I will attempt to be as plain and practical as I can.</p>

The firſt Improvement then that we muſt endeavour to make of theſe Tranſcendencies, is, to get the Mind into a quiet, calm and ſedate Frame.

                     <hi>CONSIDERATION</hi> I.</head>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Conſideration</hi> for the quieting our Mind, is this; <hi>That even in theſe Tranſcendent Doctrines and Providences, we may behold the footſteps of Gods Tranſcendency and incomprehenſible Greatneſs, whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to conclude they are of God.</hi> The which is ſo <hi>admirably ordered,</hi> that we may ſee that they are ſuted and adjuſted unto the <hi>Make</hi> of Man for his Good.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider the Tranſcendency of God, the Infinity of him in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Perfection, I cannot but be abundantly ſatisfied to behold the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps and impreſſes thereof in the things that are before me, eſpecially when I alſo find that all is ſo excellently well ſuited to man for his Good, that as God makes a Diſplay of his Glory, ſo he doth diſcover the greatneſs of his Goodneſs, even unto us. This great and mighty God making Man for Himſelf, for his own Honour and Glory, cannot glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Himſelf by Man, but in a way <hi>like Himſelf;</hi> that is, in a way infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:42587:226" rendition="simple:additions"/> above us, in a way that tranſcends our narrow Underſtandings; whence 'tis that all thoſe Revelations or Doctrines that are with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this great End, as are all the Myſterious Doctrines of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all thoſe Providences that contribute to the bringing it to paſs, are ſo much above us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, God did not only deſign his own Glory in theſe Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with men, but alſo our Good, and therefore 'tis that thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Providences that are adjuſted to theſe Ends, are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſuited to our Capacity; how elſe could they be for our Good? If in all reſpects they ſhould be infinitely above us, we ſhould not be able to apprehend any thing of them, and then they could be of no Uſe unto us; and as they are ſuited to our Capacity, even ſo they are ſuch as bear on them the Signatures and Impreſſes of that great God from and by whom they are, and for whoſe Glory deſigned. If we believe that there are any Tranſactions between God and Man, we muſt entertain this Opinion concerning theſe Doctrines and Providences that are deſigned for the bringing them to paſs. They muſt be ſo manifeſt and obvious unto us, as to direct us concerning what is neceſſary to be done on our part towards the obtaining the great Ends, and alſo ſuch as beſpeak them to be of God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> there muſt be ſomewhat in them ſo high and profound, as to be beyond us.</p>
                  <p>Whoever will but intenſely obſerve the things that are before us, whether in the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral World,</hi> will find ſomewhat <hi>plain,</hi> and within our compaſs, and other things to us <hi>dark</hi> and obſcure, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending our underſtandings; the which is to ſhew, that all things that proceed from God, are deſigned both for our good, and the illuſtrating the Glory of him from whom they proceed. They are deſigned part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our Good, and therefore partly within our compaſs; they are alſo intended to ſhew forth the Glory of God, and therefore in them there is ſomewhat infinitely above us, tranſcending our Capacities; the which being ſo, 'tis not very difficult to ſhew what Improvement we may make of what tranſcends us. Yea, we may hereby learn to make as gracious Improvement of what is obſcure, as of what is more plain and obvious: For hereby, to the great ſatisfaction of our Souls, we ſee much of God in theſe Doctrines and Providences. Their Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is a Demonſtration that they are of God.</p>
                  <p>'Tis remarkable, that in the moſt Myſterious Doctrines and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences there is ſomewhat apprehenſible by us, enough to oblige us to conclude that there is no Implication in the Doctrines, nor any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between one and another. They are not contrary unto our Reaſons, neither are the Providences ſuch, but that what difficulty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever about them lies before us, they are not unworthy of God; only we cannot ſee <hi>how,</hi> without all ſcruple to ſatisfie our ſelves concerning ſome things of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:42587:227" rendition="simple:additions"/> that the Doctrines and Providences are ſuch as in their own nature are uncapable of a Solution; but this only we can ſay, we know not <hi>how</hi> to ſolve them. There is ſomewhat in them that is above us, the which does but ſhew that they are from God. If the Doctrines and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences had been in all reſpects plain and obvious, how could it appear they had been of God; ſurely what, things ſoever are in all reſpects ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily within our compaſs, cannot be ſuppoſed to be from one infinitely above us; wherefore then that the World may ſee that the Author of Chriſtian Doctrines and Providences is God, God has left ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Idea's of himſelf upon them, the which may be obſerved in every thing that is <hi>of God.</hi> In thoſe very things that are <hi>moſt known</hi> unto us, if well look'd into, we ſhall find ſomewhat extraordinary; the Reaſon of which we cannot with any ſatisfaction fully diſcover, for there is ſtill in them ſomewhat beyond us.</p>
                  <p>We may know that this or the other thing <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>what it is,</hi> but <hi>how</hi> 'tis ſo, or ſo, we know not. This is true of things In the <hi>Natural</hi> World, we know that this is, and what it is, but cannot diſtinctly ſhew <hi>how</hi> it is what it is, or <hi>how</hi> it poſſibly ſhould be what it is. We know <hi>we ſee,</hi> and what we mean when we ſay <hi>we ſee;</hi> but yet if we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we do ſee until an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> be laid down, on which, without any ſcruple all the many <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or difficult Appearances that ariſe from the conſideration <hi>how</hi> we ſee, be ſolv'd, we ſhall never believe we do ſee. 'Tis true, we know that we ſee by the Eye, but <hi>how</hi> by the <hi>Eye,</hi> is the difficulty. The Eye and the Object are at a diſtance, they muſt be ſo, if we will ſee by the Eye; but <hi>how,</hi> by what <hi>Medium</hi> are they brought together? Is there an emiſſion of ſomewhat from the Eye, or an interception of any thing that may be ſuppoſed to paſs from the Object to the Organ? Whether the one or the other, is it Corporeal, or Incorporeal, Material, or Immaterial? Not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for what is Incorporeal, Immaterial, cannot convey the <hi>Species</hi> to the Eye; nor what is Corporeal for many other Reaſons. Whoever will conſult the Old, and (eſpecially) the New Philophers, may ſee how much is diſcourſed on this Subject, and how little to ſatisfaction. The like of <hi>Hearing,</hi> ef <hi>Motion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In Philoſophy, for this very Reaſon, namely, Becauſe God has left ſome <hi>Idea's</hi> or <hi>Footſteps</hi> of himſelf on the things that are made, there are variety of <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> but not one that can ſolve every <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> or difficult Appearance. That of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is now exploded by moſt; the old <hi>Epicurean Dogmata</hi> revived by <hi>Peter Gaſſend,</hi> and the almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of ſome others, of which we have but ſome Scraps in <hi>Cicero, Laertius</hi> his Life of the Heathen Philoſophers and others, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> are all inſufficient for the deſigned End. <hi>Des C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This is ſo manifeſt, as that there is hardly a great Wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is in one

                  </p>
                  <p>If this then be ſo in the <hi>Natural</hi> World, how much more may we ſuppoſe it to be ſo in the <hi>Moral</hi> World, in which it pleaſeth the Lord in a more eſpecial manner to make Diſcoveries of Himſelf? The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Syſteme does after a more lively manner contain the Portraicture of the Divine Perfections, and therefore in it there muſt be ſomewhat that is more above us than in the Natural. We know Goſpel Doctrines &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences that do tranſcend our capacity, we know what the Doctrines are, &amp; we know that there is reaſon enough to conclude that theſe Doctrines &amp; Providences are of God, &amp; an Additional Argument to confirm us in this Judgment, is, <hi>that they are above us.</hi> There are the Marks and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures of Infinity and Incomprehenſibility upon them. But ſhall the very thing that is deſigned as an Argument to evince that they are of God, move us to conclude that they are not of him? If there had not been ſomewhat extraordinary, ſomewhat in theſe things above us, we might doubt concerning their being of God; but now there is no place left for ſuch doubtings. Beſides, we muſt conſider that the Doctrines that fill our Minds with various thoughts, being clearly revealed in Scripture, though not eaſily underſtood, are ſtill to be embrac'd; for 'tis their being about the deep things of God, that occaſion their being ſo far above us. They are about the eternal Counſels and Purpoſes of the moſt High, the Acts and Operations of him, who is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; the Contrivances of fall'n Mans Salvation in a way conſiſtent with the Glory of every Attribute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are Matters ſo grand, that 'twould be impoſſible for any finite Capacity to comprehend them, much more ſo for ſuch imperfect Worms as our ſelves. The Doctrines being about theſe deep Points, muſt needs be above us, as the Subject Matter about which theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> are, be above us. The Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency then of theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſhould afford <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto us, as it beſpeaks them to be of God. God utters things <hi>like a God,</hi> when he reveals theſe profound and Myſterious <hi>Doctrines.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Providences.</hi> God acts like himſelf, as well as ſpeaks like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Yea, and God acts like himſelf in all his Works of <hi>Providence,</hi> as well as in the works of <hi>Creation;</hi> yea in the works of <hi>Gubernation,</hi> as well as in thoſe of <hi>Conſervation.</hi> We cannot comprehend <hi>how</hi> our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are conſerved, for 'tis done by God; neither can we underſtand <hi>how</hi> the World is Govern'd; for 'tis God that governs, ordering all things according to the exacteſt Rules for his own Glory; whence if in the Adminiſtration of this Government, ſome Difficulties which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend our Underſtandings, do occur, 'tis an Argument that God governs the World <hi>like God,</hi> in infinite Wiſdom, and therefore in a way much above us; and therefore our Minds may be quiet and at reſt about theſe things.</p>

                  <p>The Second <hi>Conſideration</hi> for quieting our Minds, is, That <hi>the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of theſe Doctrines and Providences, does very much contribute to the exciting and ſtirring up thoſe Graces, in the exerciſe of which God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the Salvation of ſome.</hi>

                  <p>Whoever will duly obſerve what may be known of God by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries that are made of him, and what the <hi>Make</hi> of Man is, will find, That God, when at firſt he created us, had a regard to his own Glory, and Mans Salvation in the Exerciſe of Religion, whence 'tis God that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man after his own Image, and gave him a Law, that may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the Tranſcript of his own Purity and Holineſs, and yet <hi>ſuch,</hi> as was ſuited to thoſe Powers and Faculties which were at firſt given, us: Whence 'tis, that man was no ſooner created, but a Holy Law was given him, and the Promiſe of Life on his Obedience. The Law given, is no other than the <hi>Will</hi> of the great God, who made us all; which <hi>Will</hi> muſt be made known and revealed unto man, before it can have on him the force of a Law.</p>
                  <p>Now the Diſcoveries of God's <hi>Will</hi> are after a twofold manner; for there are ſome other Diſcoveries than theſe, that are by the <hi>Light of Nature.</hi> What may be underſtood by the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> from the things made, is done by the exerciſe of our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any other way, is not received the ſame way with the former, our knowledge of theſe Revelations depends not <hi>ſolely</hi> on the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of but principally on the exerciſe of <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis God, who after an extraordinary manner, has reveal'd his <hi>Will,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis on the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> we muſt lean for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof; that is, we muſt <hi>Believe,</hi> we muſt exerciſe <hi>Faith;</hi> by the Exerciſe whereof, we come to the knowledge of thoſe things which we could not arrive unto meerly by the Exerciſe of our higheſt Reaſonings; and really God delights to try and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our Faith, ſo that now eſpecially ſince the Fall, the Life and Heart of that Religion that is neceſſary to Salvation, conſiſts in the Exerciſe of <hi>Faith:</hi> To be truly Religious, and to be a ſound Believer, are expreſſions of one and the ſame import. The Religion we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for, and muſt now exerciſe, if we will be ſaved, is the Life of Faith, which is a Life much higher than that of meer Reaſon; for by Faith we know what by meer Reaſon we could never know.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the moſt momentous Points of our Religion, we ſhall find, that as they are adjuſted to our own Capacities, even ſo they are of Matters infinitely above us; they are of Matters that are not within our view; unto the knowledge of which, we cannot come, but by
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:42587:228" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome ſpecial Revelation: the certainty of which Revelations depend on the Veracity and Truth of God's Teſtimony; and 'tis our <hi>Faith</hi> alone by which we receive theſe Diſcoveries that are thus given us of God, whence 'tis ſaid, that the ſtronger our Faith is, the more we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God by believing the Truth of his Teſtimony. And that we may thus glorifie God, it hath pleaſed the Lord ſo to order the Revelations of his Mind and Will, and ſo to diſpoſe of things by his Providence, as to poſe our Reaſon, and leave us in the dark; at which time, if we lean on the Veracity and Truth of Gods Teſtimony about the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and on his Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs about his <hi>Providence,</hi> we diſcover the ſtrength and firmneſs of our <hi>Faith,</hi> to the Glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being ſo, 'tis manifeſt, That the many profound <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> that are in Scripture, and the many dark <hi>Providences</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us, do very much contribute to our living the more religiouſly <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to our walking the more by <hi>Faith,</hi> to the ſaving the Soul.</p>
                  <p>This, I conceive, is one great End of the profoundneſs of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> of Religion, and of the many difficulties in the <hi>Providences</hi> of God, namely, to raiſe us up to a Life above Senſe and Reaſon, even to the Life of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is a high and a heavenly Life.</p>
                  <p>The more Difficulties that lie in the way of our Believing, the more ſtrong is the Faith that is exerciſed; and the ſtronger our Faith, the more God is glorified by us, and the more is our Salvation furthered; the which being ſo, we have great reaſon to be abundantly quickned in our Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the Nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> we ſhall find that Myſterious <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Providences</hi> are very neceſſary for the engaging us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to the Exerciſe of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FAITH is the</hi> Evidence <hi>of things not ſeen, Heb.</hi> 11.1. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not only of unſeen future Glories, but the Evidence of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe, not within the view of our Sence or Reaſon. Faith doth evidence unto the Believer the Reality and Certainty of the Promiſes about Spiritual Bleſſings to be enjoyed in this Life, and doth clearly ſhew unto him, that theſe Bleſſings promiſed are real, and ſhall moſt aſſuredly be enjoyed; yea, though there are in the eye of our Sence, and our Natural Reaſonings, ſome Impoſſibilities between us and the inheriting the Promiſes, yet even then Faith ſees the Accompliſhment not only poſſible, but <hi>certain</hi> and ſure.</p>
                  <p>By Faith we believe and receive thoſe Truths which, though clearly enough revealed, yet are ſo much above our Capacity, that we cannot otherwiſe embrace them.</p>

                  <p>By Faith we believe that the Promiſe ſhall be, when we cannot ſee <hi>how</hi> it can be. Thus was the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> exercis'd; He believed when his Sight and Reaſon fail'd him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an hundred years old, and as it were dead, <hi>Sarah</hi> barren, and now according to all Rules paſt Child-bearing, notwithſtanding all which, the Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, that <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould bear a Son, <hi>Abraham</hi> believes; he could ſee <hi>how</hi> this could be, by Faith, though he could not ſee <hi>how</hi> it could be, by his Reaſon. According to his own Reaſonings his Hopes were gone, but <hi>being ſtrong in Faith, he ſtaggered not at the Promiſe,</hi> but had a hope above Hope, <hi>being fully perſwaded, that what God had promiſed, he was</hi> able <hi>alſo to perform,</hi> Rom. 4. The like alſo when God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son, his own, his only Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom he loved and of whom the Promiſe was, for in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy Seed be called, but nevertheleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to kill him for a Sacrifice, but here is the difficulty, if <hi>Iſaac</hi> be ſlain while ſo young as he then was, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had any child, how could the Promiſe be fulfilled? <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt kill him, and yet believe, that he ſhould live, that he might be the Father of many Nations, but how could this be? Surely this tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Underſtanding, but not his Faith; for he believed, That God was able to raiſe him from the dead, therefore 'tis ſaid by Faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was tempted offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> accounting that God was able to raiſe him up from the dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19. Time would fail to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, David,</hi> and many others, who when ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dark Diſpenſations, by Believing gave Glory to God. Then Faith is in a ſpecial manner acted and exerciſed, when the Believer is compaſſed about with a cloud of difficulties; when in the Doctrines (that being plainly reveal'd) are to be believed, there is ſomewhat above our Reaſon, and when in the Providences with which we meet, there is ſomewhat very dark, they ſeeming to thwart the doctrinal Diſcoveries, that are made of the Will of God unto us, then is the time to act Faith, that is not Faith, which does carry us no higher than our own ſcanty Reaſonings. To believe no more than we can comprehend with our own Reaſon, is too low a thing to deſerve the name of Faith, Faith is a more noble and raiſed Grace by which a man believes, when his Reaſon is at a Loſs.</p>
                  <p>What is here ſaid of Faith is a great Truth, and if duely weighed will afford relief to ſuch as are perplexed with the profoundneſs of ſome Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For by this tis manifeſt, That the Myſteriouſneſs of the Doctrines, the ſurprizing manner in which they are reveal'd, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties about the <hi>Hebrew Points,</hi> and ſome Inſtances in Chronology, the various Readings and the like; they all ſerve as a ſpur to our Faith, and a furtherance to our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>We have Arguments enough to convince us of the Truth of Scripture the certainty of a divine Providence, and therefore we ought not to be unbelieving, though we meet with ſome Difficulties that our Reaſon
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:42587:229" rendition="simple:additions"/> cannot overcome. This ſhould ſatisfy us, that how great ſoever the difficulties may be, how far ſoever they tranſcend our Underſtandings, yet there is in 'em no Implication, and if ſo, they are in themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable, and although finite worms are not acquainted with the true Methods of Conciliation, yet God, who is Infinite in all perfections, is Theſe difficulties ſhould not in the leaſt ſtumble our Faith, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to be the more ſtrong in believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As by Faith we behold the Accompliſhment of the Promiſes, which are not comprehended by our Reaſon, and can thorough the Myſteriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Doctrines and Providences ſee that they are of God, ſo by <hi>Faith we are enabled to put our truſt,</hi> and <hi>Confidence in God,</hi> even <hi>when under the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt Diſpenſations.</hi> Faith never appears ſo much in its luſtre as when the greateſt difficulties lie before it. Then tis that the Believer puts his truſt in the Power, Wiſdom, Mercy and Faithfulneſs of God, when under the obſcureſt Diſpenſations. When there are ſome difficult Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the Sacred Scriptures that relate to ſome Doctrines, and when ſome Providences ſeem to be contrary to the diſcoveries that are made of God's Faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then 'tis that our Faith appears in its beauty; for thereby we ſhew the juſt apprehenſions we have of God's Power, Wiſdom, Mercy and Faithfulneſs. That God has promiſed to extend his Compaſſions to Believers, that he will order all things to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good, is evident enough in Scripture; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, all things ſeem to be againſt them, they are afflicted, and under ſore temptations, they loſe their temporal Eſtates, are deprived of their Liberty, are ſick, weak, and in great diſtreſs, ſeveral thwarting Providences attend them, all things are ſeemingly againſt them: thus it was with good old <hi>Jacob,</hi> he is bereaved of his Children, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is not, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But yet this was the time for <hi>Jacob</hi> to exerciſe his Faith, as he did in the following Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>q. d. The Lord Almighty be with you,</hi> with him I leave you; to him I commit my Concerns; <hi>if I am bereaved, I am bereaved (i. e.)</hi> the will of the Lord be done. Thus it was with <hi>Job;</hi> God had ſuffered the Tempter to break in upon him; God himſelf ſeemed as if he was reſolved he ſhould die; and yet then could <hi>Job</hi> ſay, <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I put my truſt in him,</hi> Job 13.15. So with <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> chap. 13.17, 18, 19. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, though the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, though the ſlocks ſhall be cut off the Fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, the Lord God is my ſtrength, he will make me to walk in mine high places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other Inſtances might be given, all which concur to evince, That then is the time to put our truſt in the Lord, when we are in the dark, and can ſee no light, when there are in the Providences of God ſomewhat above us, that we cannot reach unto, then 'tis that we are to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:42587:230" rendition="simple:additions"/> look unto a Rock that is higher than our ſelves; then are we called to put our truſt in the Wiſdom and Mercy and Faithfulneſs of him who hath promiſed to be with us, to uphold and ſupport us, as ſaid <hi>David, At what time I am afraid I will truſt in the Lord; for though my Heart and my Fleſh fail, yet God will be the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> On the other ſide, when at the ſight of the proſperity of the wicked, the Believers feet were almoſt gone, and his ſteps did well-nigh ſlip, tis his Confidence in God that is then his ſtay. The Providences of God in this Inſtance are remarkable; for though God had ſaid, that <hi>the wicked ſhall not proſper, nor live out half their days, yet behold they live, and their houſes are ſafe from fear, they proſper in the world, they increaſe in riches.</hi> How is this conſiſtent with the threatning? or how can the righteous ſee this, and not be troubled? Surely when they enter into the Sanctuary, they ſee the End of all, and are abundantly ſatisfied; their Faith is hereby tried, but yet they can ſay, <hi>Good is God to Iſrael.</hi> They begin to reaſon with God, and will ſay, <hi>Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly?</hi> but ſtill conclude, that <hi>the Lord is righteous,</hi> Jer. 12.1. <hi>Though Clouds and Darkneſs are round about him, yet Righteouſneſs and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne:</hi> For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the dark Diſpenſations, the Godly do ſtill put their truſt in the Lord, they ſtay themſelves on his Wiſdom, Power, Mercy, and Faithfulneſs: the doing which, all ſhould endeavour when under dark Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby the Grace of <hi>Patience</hi> is to the Glory of God held up in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued exerciſe. <hi>Patience</hi> is not to be conſider'd to conſiſt meerly in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the conflict of Temptations and Afflictions with a quiet, calm and ſedate temper of Spirit, but alſo in a quiet waiting for, and expectation of the accompliſhment of ſome great and glorious Promiſes, in looking and patiently waiting for the End, when we ſhall ſee with much clearneſs what now lieth in the dark, and out of our view. <hi>But if we hope for what we ſee not, then do we with Patience wait for it,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25.</p>
                  <p>Now there ſeems to be ſome inconſiſtency between Doctrine and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, between ſome Doctrines and Providences, yea and between Providences and Providences, but yet we muſt conclude, That 'tis not ſo, and that the time will come when our Lord will not ſpeak any more in Parables unto us, when the Vail ſhall be done away, and when we ſhall find every thing to anſwer the Truth and Holineſs of God, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency in any of the Doctrines and Providences, but the exacteſt Agreement, and moſt excellent Harmony, every one Doctrine and Providence concurring to the illuſtration of each other; all which ſhall be ſeen with great ſatisfaction when we ſhall depart hence and be with the Lord. <hi>Now we know but in part, we ſee but through a Glaſs darkly, but then we ſhall know as we are known, and ſee Face to face;</hi> the Vail ſhall be taken away; 'tis true, even then ſomewhat will tranſcend our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:42587:230" rendition="simple:additions"/> for the Reaſons ſuggeſted in the firſt Conſideration. We muſt not think that God can diveſt himſelf of his Divinity, or make any thing that has not in one regard or other ſome Impreſſes that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its Author to be infinite; neither muſt we imagine that man ſhall ceaſe to be man, or ceaſe to be a Finite weight, neither hope that his capacity ſhall be enlarged to comprehend Infiniteneſs, but this we may ſafely conclude, That we ſhall <hi>know more hereafter</hi> than now, and that the preſent Darkneſs with which we are now ſurrounded, is no more than what is ſuited to the ſtate in which we now live. They that are born of God, are encompaſſed with thoſe Remainders of old Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which greatly indiſpoſe us for the receiving greater Light.</p>
                  <p>There is an admirable Order to be obſerved in the Works and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that which is Natural, then that which is Spiritual: firrſt, that which is leſs perfect, then that which is more perfect: firſt, a dark Evening, then a glorious Morning: firſt, Star-light, that is, Light ſhining in dark places, then the Day-Star from on high, the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes to enlighten our darkneſs: firſt, the Knowledge the World had of God and Chriſt was very little, then ſome ſhadowy Repreſentations were made of heavenly Truths, and now the <hi>Image,</hi> but not yet the heavenly things themſelves. Under the Law was the Shadow of Heavenly things <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a draught of Heavenly things in Water-colours, now the Image of Heavenly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. that is, a more lively Repreſentation or Portraiture of them. Under the Law there was a Vail over the Peoples Faces, they could ſee but the Shadow, but we all with open face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with a face unvail'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Glory of the Lord, but as in a Glaſs, in which we have but the Image; for Chriſt, though he brought us a clearer diſcovery of things, yet conſidered our ſtate, and therefore ſpake but of earthly things, <hi>John</hi> 3.12. That is, the diſcovery that now we have is very dark to what it ſhall be in Heaven, when we are capable of receiving Heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and look into the Heavenly things themſelves. Now we ſee that the diſcoveries that are made unto us, are of God; for the Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of infinite wiſdom are found on them, but then the diſcovery will be more full, more clear, diſtinct and ſatisfying. Now we know but juſt enough to quicken us to look for further Knowledge about the Doctrines and Providences of God; and the more we know, the more we deſire to know; and ſuch as have form'd any right Conceptions about them, cannot but conclude, there is ſomewhat excellent in the knowledge of theſe things, and though the more we pry into them now, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied we are, becauſe we know no more; yet this is ſome Relief, That we ſhall know more hereafter; whence 'tis, that a Judicious and Underſtanding Chriſtian is the more inclin'd to leave this dark State, looking for that State of Viſion in which we ſhall know and ſee more of God, his Ways and Workings.</p>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:42587:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Really there is an extraordinary ſatisfaction that will attend us in that ſtate wherein we ſhall be filled with as much and as diſtinct a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as our Underſtandings are capable of receiving; the which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is too great an happineſs for ſinful Mortals here; 'tis a Felicity reſerv'd for hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid of the Providences of God, which may be conſidered as a <hi>curious</hi> Work, a part of which only is within our view, and becauſe we ſee not the whole, we are at a loſs concerning what we ſee; for we find moſt of the ſeveral <hi>Parts</hi> that are before us, to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Order or Comlineſs, the which muſt neceſſarily be ſo, becauſe 'tis but a <hi>Part</hi> of the work that we ſee, and the Beauty which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of that admirable Connection that is to be between part and part in the putting <hi>all</hi> things together, cannot be ſeen till the end of all, for which we muſt both hope and patiently wait.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, many Inſtances can be given wherein the ſeveral parts of Providence, with reſpect to this or the other godly man, ſeem very ſtrange and ſurprizing, and yet put together, render the higheſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a good man, and had a Right to the Promiſe, That <hi>all things ſhould work together for his good,</hi> but yet if you conſider ſome Providences relating to him diſtinctly, you will find all things againſt him; namely, that he ſhould be ſold by his Brethren, that he ſhould be carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and when in <hi>Potiphars</hi> Houſe, be falſly accuſed by his Miſtris and caſt into Priſon, and there continue for a long time; but yet put theſe Providences together, and you will ſee what dependance the one had on the other, and how all are joyned together for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Advancement; for had not <hi>Joſeph</hi> been ſold by his Brethren, how could he have been brought down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and placed in the capacity of a Servant with <hi>Potiphar?</hi> and if he had not been with <hi>Potiphar,</hi> how could he by the falſe Accuſation of his Miſtris, be impriſoned? and if not impriſoned, how could he have had the opportunity of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chief Butler's Dream, which was the occaſion of his being call'd before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> by which means <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſo highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as to be made Ruler over all the Land of <hi>Egypt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other Inſtances might be given, but this is ſufficient to ſhew, that the great reaſon, why many providences ſo far tranſcend our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that we cannot find out the Conſiſtency, the admirable Order and Harmony that is in them, is this, namely, we ſee not the End; if we could ſee the End, we ſhould have a fuller ſatisfaction, but till then we muſt patiently wait.</p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:42587:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>By this 'tis evident that the Correſpondency of theſe Doctrines and Providences is an excellent Expedient to excite thoſe Graces that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and therefore our Minds may very well be quieted without it.</p>

               <p>The Second <hi>Improvement</hi> is this; <hi>We may from the Tranſcendency of theſe Doctrines and Providences, fetch an unanſwerable Argument to confirm and eſtabliſh us in the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been already urged for the quieting of our Minds about theſe inſoluble Difficulties, 'twas ſhewn, that the Tranſcendency that is in theſe Doctrines and Providences, was but the footſteps of God's Tranſcendency. Let us then but take this for granted, and <hi>compare</hi> the Impreſſes or Footſteps that there are of God's Tranſcendency in theſe Doctrines, with thoſe on the things that are made, and to be ſeen in the Providences of God, I ſay, compare the Doctrines of the Goſpel, the things made, and his Providences together, and we ſhall find an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Harmony between them, even in this reſpect, that the footſteps of God's Tranſcendency are to be ſeen in them all. Whence we have as ſatisfying an Argument to convince us that the Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are from God, and conſequently true, as that the world was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, and is now under his <hi>Government;</hi> yea ſuch as believe a Providence, and the Scripture to be the Word of God, have as much to offer for their Faith as the meer <hi>Deiſt</hi> (who only belive the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of a God) has for his; for the very ſame Characters, Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Impreſſes and Footſteps of Gods infinite Perfections that are on the things made, are in theſe Doctrines and Providences, of which the Tranſcendency that is in them, is an uncontroulable Evidence. Why do we believe the World to be made of God, but becauſe we ſee that the things made are ſo admirably fram'd and order'd, that there is ſomewhat in them incomprehenſible by us? They are made by One whoſe Wiſdom is infinite, and tranſcends our largeſt Capacities. In like manner thoſe who will look into the Scriptures, and conſult the Doctrines of the Goſpel, will find that there are the Impreſſes of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom in them, which could not be unleſs they had been of God, who is infinitely wiſe; whence 'tis that by the Tranſcendency that is in the Doctrines, we are engaged to conclude that they are true <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we are hereby confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd in the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that is diſcover'd unto us in the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <hi>IMPROVEMENT.</hi> III.</head>
               <p>The Third <hi>Improvement</hi> is this; <hi>The Tranſcendency of theſe Doctrines and Providences prove moſt excellent Expedients to ſilence and ſtop the mouths of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly; for by the Tranſcendency of ſome Doctrines and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, God is carrying on the great End of glorifying his Righteouſneſs in the letting out his Fury and Indignation on the Veſſels of Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God who made all things for himſelf, will be Glorified either <hi>by</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> the People he has made: God will be glorified <hi>by</hi> ſome to their Salvation, and <hi>upon</hi> others in their Condemnation. And by the Tranſcendency that is in the Doctrines and Providences, both are done: For the Tranſcendency of theſe Doctrines and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, as hath been already ſhewn, exciting the Faith and Patience of ſome, does farther their Salvation; and as they are ſtumbling-Blocks in the way of others, they occaſion the Ruine and Deſtruction of others.</p>
               <p>Theſe Tranſcendent Doctrines and Providences muſt be conſidered as ſtumbling-blocks that God puts in their way, not that there is any Evil in God's putting them in the way, but the Evil is only from the indiſpoſition of the corrupt Heart of man.</p>
               <p>For the clearer underſtanding which, we muſt conſider that there is certainly ſuch a Decree as that of the <hi>Election</hi> of ſome particular Perſons unto Glory; which doth neceſſarily infer the dereliction of others, the leaving them in a ſtate of Sin and Miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some being Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, ſhall through the ſanctification of the Spirit unto Obedience, and the ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, obtain Salvation with Eternal Glory: But others there are, even ungodly men, who turn the Grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and who were of old ordained unto Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Salvation of ſome, the Damnation of others, is acknowledged by all to be certain as to the <hi>Event,</hi> and that there is no event in time, but what was foreknown of God from Eternity, is not denied by any that believe God to be God; and that theſe Events cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Providence of God, is moſt manifeſt. 'Tis true, God has a greater influence on the Elect, than on others; for God does not only ſupport their Powers and Faculties, and by a Phyſical Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enable them to perform what is Natural in their Moral Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but moreover God does by his mighty Power in infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſweetly determine the Elect to the doing what is morally good,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:42587:232" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſavingly gracious, God does not ſo much in ſuch Actions as are ſinful and vicious; the moral Vitioſity or Obliquity that is in a ſinful Action, is not of God, though what is natural in a ſinful Action, has its Origin and Riſe from God, yet what is Moral and Vitious, is not from God, God does not Phyſically and Invincibly determine any man to what is ſinful in any Action; the Sinfulneſs of an Action has no higher Being than a Creature for its Author. However, though the Sins of the Damned are without a Divine Phyſical Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, yet <hi>not without</hi> a Divine Providence. There is no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent without a Providence of God: As all Events are according to the fore-knowledge of God, ſo they are <hi>by</hi> his Providence. The Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Red Sea, according to the fore-knowledge of God, and the hardneſs of his Heart, that was the Cauſe of his ruine was <hi>by</hi> Gods Providence. This Providence is ſomewhat more than a meer unconcerned permiſſion, and yet much leſs than a Phyſical Predetermination; it falls ſhort of this latter, becauſe God has no Phyſical influence on the ſinfulneſs of our Actions, and 'tis more than the former; for the Wiſdom and Power of God is marvellouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in doing very much towards the bringing the Event to paſs, and that by <hi>laying ſtumbling blocks in the way of the Non-Elect;</hi> which ſtumbling blocks in our way, may <hi>occaſion</hi> our Sin and Ruine, but not <hi>cauſe</hi> it; ſo that although the Lord does lay Stones of ſtumbling in our way, which occaſions our Sin, yet he cannot be ſaid to be the Cauſe or Author of our Sin. No one is the Cauſe or Author of anothers Sin, but he who does either Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically or Morally contribute to the Commiſſion of Sin; but though God lays ſtones of ſtumbling before the Sinner, yet he does not in doing ſo, either morally by perſwaſions draw, or phyſically by Impreſſion drive him to the Sin. The ſtumbling block is before him, and from it the Sinner takes occaſion to ſin againſt the Lord. Though ſuch is the infinite Knowledge and Wiſdom of God, that he foreknows that ſuch a Block in the Sinners way, will occaſion his Sin, and notwithſtanding puts it in his way, yet he is not therefore the Author of his Sin, becauſe God does not hereby either Phyſically or Morally move the Sinner to the Sin; for the Sinner having a Natural power to withſtand it, 'tis his Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Sin he does not.</p>
               <p>That God does lay ſtones of ſtumbling before us, is evident enough to any who will conſult the Sacred Scriptures. In <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> 3.20. 'tis ſaid that God doth lay a ſtumbling block before the man who was externally Righteous, and he turns from his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto Sin, and dies in his Iniquity.</p>
               <p>This will appear more convincingly in the Inſtances I will give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>

               <p>In like manner are the many profound Doctrines of the Goſpel, ſtones of ſtumbling. Chriſt <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Doctrines of Chriſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as relate to the Meanneſs of his Perſon, but many others, are as ſtones of ſtumbling, and rocks of offence <hi>to both the Houſes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and for a Gin, and for a Snare, and many among them ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and be broken, and be ſnared, and be taken,</hi> Iſa. 8.14, 15.</p>
               <p>For this very reaſon, I humbly conclude, there are ſo many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; things hard to be underſtood in the Scriptures, ſo many difficulties about the Original, the various Readings of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, for this Reaſon do many wicked men increaſe in Riches, they have much Silver and Gold, but 'tis a ſtumbling block unto them, even <hi>the ſtumbling block of their Iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 7.19. <hi>Their very Tables are made a Snare, a Trap, a ſtumbling block, a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence unto the wicked.</hi> Oh! how many do take occaſion from the ſeveral Difficulties that lie before them in the Word of God, and in his Providences, to reject all Religion, to the eternal deſtruction of their own Souls; the which is done to the Exaltation of the glorious Righteouſneſs of God, that is ſeen in the Condemnation of the Veſſels of Wrath, who were endured with much long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and all this by the ſignal Providence of God, which are concerned in the Accompliſhment of theſe high Ends, yet ſo, that the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God appears <hi>as</hi> glorious <hi>as</hi> does his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> for God, who lays theſe ſtumbling blocks before us, does not cauſe our Sin, for that only follows our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in our way, as the product of our own Corruption.</p>
               <p>'Tis admirable to conſider, that the very ſame thing, that is a Mean to excite Grace in the <hi>One,</hi> ſhould be an Occaſion of Infidelity and other Sins in <hi>Another.</hi> That ſuch Contrarieties ſhould in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways proceed from one and the ſame Providence; that one and the ſame thing ſhould be a <hi>Means</hi> of the Salvation of the one, and the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the Deſtruction of the other. There is much
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:42587:233" rendition="simple:additions"/> of infinite Wiſdom to be ſeen in this Contrivance; for hereby, <hi>in the very ſame thing</hi> that proves an occaſion of the Ruine of the non-Elect, there is enough to ſtop their mouths, and ſilence them, and all ſuch as do take occaſion therefrom to ſin againſt God. For what ever the ſecret Counſels of God are concerning this or the other particular Perſon, God does treat all in a way ſutable to thoſe Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities he has given us, he conſiders us all as Rational Creatures, as Moral Agents, and has taken us all under his Government, and is as <hi>ſincere</hi> in the Promiſes of Life he makes unto all on their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with his terms, as he is <hi>juſt</hi> and true in the execution of the threatned Evils againſt ſuch as remain obſtinate Tranſgreſſors; and as for the inſuperable Difficulties that lie before us, the Doctrines and Providences that tranſcend our Underſtandings, they are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Expedients to engage us to believe to the ſaving of the Soul, as they are the occaſions of that Unbelief that ends in the damnation of thoſe that periſh.</p>
               <p>Wherefore then ſeeing this is ſo, ſeeing ſo much good may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from theſe Doctrines and Providences, ſuch as take occaſion from them to ſin, to reject all Religion, and live Atheiſtically in the World, are without <hi>Excuſe;</hi> for 'tis manifeſt, that a better Uſe might have been made of thefe things, and that 'tis their own Sin, that they have made ſo ill an Uſe thereof, the which will not in the leaſt excuſe, but aggravate their Miſery, and juſtifie God in their Condemnation.</p>

               <p>Such is the boldneſs of moſt men, that they fear not to pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things that are above them, even into the Secrets of the moſt High. We are not ſatisfied with what is revealed, but are too curiouſly ſearching into the hidden things of God; although 'tis impoſſible that this Curioſity ſhould be attended with the deſired ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and although it proved fatal to our firſt Parents, who deſiring to know more than was meet, fell from that happy ſtate in which they were at firſt placed, yet the temper of moſt ſtudious Enquirers is to be too curious and bold; and this they will be, though they turn the whole World into confuſion by their Conteſts.</p>
               <p>'Tis not unworthy our thoughts to conſider what is the principal ground of the many Quarrels and Wranglings that have been and are
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:42587:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> among the Learned; for then we ſhall find that a too bold Enquiry into the things that are above us, and unlawful to be pried into, is the ground of all. There is in us an ambition to be like unto God, we would fain know as much as he who is Omniſcient; our Souls, though in their own Nature, are finite, yet in the deſires they have of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, are in a manner infinite. The deep things of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape our narroweſt ſearch; the Nature of his Being, the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Media</hi> of his Operations, and his eternal Counſels fall under our ſtricteſt Scrutiny and boldeſt Debates.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange to conſider with what Confidence vain Mortals will diſpute about theſe things, and no leſs ſurprizing to obſerve the great Confuſion and Diſorders that have followed ſuch Diſputes. How confidently do the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randiſts,</hi> and other Schoolmen among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> and <hi>Anti-Remonſtrants,</hi> the <hi>Supra</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> talk of God, his Decrees, and their Order, as well as about <hi>Phyſical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>What more manifeſt, than that there are ſome Doctrines and Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which tranſcend our Underſtandings; or than that we are but feeble and impotent Beings, who cannot ſearch them out? This is not only ſuppoſed in our Queſtion, but has been already evinc'd in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And is it ſo? Is there ſuch a Tranſcendency in the Doctrines and Providences of God? Is there ſomewhat ſecret, ſomewhat above us, and yet ſhall we by an unjuſtifiable Curioſity in prying into theſe Secrets, preſume on God? What! doſt thou not conſider, that God is infinitely above thee, that he dwelleth in that Light that no Eye can approach unto; that his Throne is in the Heavens; and that there are Clouds and Darkneſs round about him, and that his Glory is inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? why then art thou not afraid to come too near him; why dareſt thou to fix thine eye upon him?</p>
               <p>The Tranſcendency of the Doctrines and Providences of God is his <hi>Glory;</hi> which no Eye can ſee and live; and yet preſumeſt thou to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a ſight thereof? Behold! when a glimpſe of the Glory of the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:42587:234" rendition="simple:additions"/> Lord appeared but in the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the People could not bear it, and therefore a Vail was put on his face; and art not thou as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold the Glory it ſelf, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to fix their Eye on a glimpſe of it? Conſider the Shinings of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s face repreſent unto us the Beauty, and Luſtre, and bright Glory that is in the Doctrines of God; ſo great was the Light of Goſpel-Doctrines then, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not bear it, and therefore it pleaſed the Lord in compaſſion to humane weakneſſes to give them but the ſhadow of heavenly things; the glorious Light of thoſe Doctrines was under the Vail, 'twas hid under Types and Ceremonies, ſo that they had but ſome darker repreſentations, ſuch as they could bear; and <hi>now,</hi> though we are enabled to bear more, and accordingly have clearer Diſcoveries of this glorious Light, yet not being able to bear the Light it ſelf, the heavenly things themſelves, we have but the <hi>Image;</hi> though the Vail is not ſuch as hides from us ſo much of the Glory as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Types did, yet the Vail that is over the Glory <hi>now,</hi> is ſuch as keeps us from ſeeing it, <hi>as it is.</hi> The Truth of which is confirm'd unto us by the Tranſcendency we now find in theſe Doctrines; there is a Cloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in them and <hi>us,</hi> and therfore we cannot find them fully out; the which being ſo, it ſhould teach us to conſider our own State and condition, how weak and feeble we are, and what reaſon we have to be humble and modeſt in all our Enquiries about theſe things.</p>
               <p>Could we but believe that the Tranſcendency that is in the Doctrines and Providences of God, is what indeed it is, an unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confirm us in the Truth of this Point, namely, <hi>That there is an inacceſſible Glory in thoſe Doctrines and Providences, even that Light which we are not able to bear,</hi> or <hi>to behold and live;</hi> we ſhould ſee cauſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more grand, auguſt, and awful Apprehenſions of God, as well as lower thoughts of our ſelves, and then inſtead of dſſputing <hi>boldly</hi> about theſe Tranſcendencies, we ſhould find reaſon enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our own frailty and weakneſs, and in the ſenſe thereof to be humble and modeſt in all our Diſquiſitions. Alas! what is man that he ſhould come ſo near the Ark of God, or dare make too near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the Mount that burns, and is covered with a Cloud of Smoke and great Darkneſs?</p>
               <p>Whoever will duly conſider, How that man when in Innocency was moſtly diſpoſed to cloſe with the Temptation of being <hi>like</hi> unto God in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and that the Lord ever ſince the Fall, hath taken ſpecial care to keep us very much in the dark, may eaſily ſee, that the Uſe we are to make of the Tranſcendency of the Doctrines and Providences of God, is to <hi>walk humbly before the Lord,</hi> and to be afraid to enquire too curiouſly after his Secrets. When <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt Created, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was much more full, clear, and diſtinct than afterwards it was; and no queſtion but that it afforded him ſutable delight and ſatisfaction. He ſaw ſo much Excellency in the Knowledge of God and his works,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:42587:235" rendition="simple:additions"/> that a Temptation to the doing any thing but what might encreaſe his Knowledge, would with the greateſt diſdain be contemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: <hi>This</hi> the ſubtil Tempter ſaw, and therefore recommends the forbidden Fruit, as what was rather to be choſen as a Means of enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Knowledge, than as what was pleaſing to the Taſte; <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil. Adam</hi> finding ſo much pleaſure in the Knowledge he already had, is ſoon tempted to be inordinate in the deſiring more, yea, ſo inordinate, that aſſoon as he meets with the Temptation, no Knowledge leſs than what was like unto Gods, could ſatisfie him, and ſo he fell. So that the Sin of our firſt Parents was an ambition to be like unto God in Knowledge, an inordinate deſire of knowing what could not be known by any but by him whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is infinite; and this Sin appears in all his Off-ſpring; we would fain be like unto God, and we are unwilling to be ſatisfied with ſuch Meaſures as the Lord appoints, and therefore are prying into the deep things of God. Such are our low thoughts of God, and ſuch are the high thoughts we have of our ſelves, that we think it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know God to perfection, and therefore are ſo curious and ſtrict in our enquiry after him.</p>
               <p>But it has pleaſed the Lord to ſhew himſelf to be God, and that we are but men, by the wonders he hath wrought on Earth. Hence proud man in aſpiring after more Knowledge than was meet, has loſt what he formerly had; his Underſtanding is darkned, his Heart is blinded, he cannot ſee, the Faculties of his Soul, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, yet not in their primitive ſtrength and vigor, they are greatly impaired and corrupted; yea, the enlightned Minds of the Regenerate have on them ſuch remainders of old Corruption, as unfits them for the receiving all that may be known of God. And ever ſince the Fall, the Methods God has taken in enlightning men, is ſuch, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that we are but men, finite worms, who cannot comprehend the infinite Glories of the Lord. For it has pleaſed the Lord to give unto the Children of men ſome darker repreſentations of himſelf, and and in thoſe Revelations that are moſt plain and clear, there is enough to demonſtrate, that there is ſomewhat in every Doctrine and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that is above us; God keeps his diſtance, he will make us know that he is the <hi>Lord,</hi> and that we are but men, even vain <hi>Worms;</hi> that cannot comprehend him, and who therefore ought to ſubmit our ſelves unto God, and humble our ſelves before him, and not come too near him; for the nearer we come, the more we are in the dark, the more at a loſs, yea the more perplexed and confuſed are our Apprehenſions. This the Tranſcendency of the Doctrines and Providences of God does evince; which is enough to ſhew, <hi>how humble</hi> we ought to be when we diſcourſe of God, and how modeſt in our Enquiries into his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Providences. Content thy ſelf therefore with what is clearly revealed, and leave what is hid and above thee unto God. Be not thou ſo bold as to meaſure the boundleſs Myſteries of God, by
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:42587:235" rendition="simple:additions"/> thy narrow confined Underſtanding; neither do thou preſume to reject what thou canſt not comprehend. What is of God is above thee, for God is God, he is cloath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

We ought therefore to be modeſt when we ſpeak of the unſearchable Doctrines and Providences of God; for in them we ſee enough to admire, but can never comprehend; and when we have ſpent all our time to find out God, and the Infinity of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Myſtery of the Trinity, the Mode of his Workings or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the depth of his Contrivances about the accompliſhing fallen mans Salvation, and all the great Counſels of God, and the Intricacy of his Providences, we muſt come to this Cloſe with the Apoſtle, <hi>O! the depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out.</hi>

            <p>Therefore our Apoſtle, like a wiſe Maſter-builder, in his Epiſtles, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as may be ſeen particularly in thoſe to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> lays a good Foundation for Goſpel-obedience, in the Grace thereof. He firſt ſets forth the great myſtery of Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Grace of God therein; and then concludes with exhortation to all duties, both to God and Man, from the conſideration thereof.</p>
            <p>He doth the like here in this to the <hi>Romans:</hi> For having, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Epiſtle, convinced both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and concluded all under ſin, and ſhewed the only way to Juſtification, to be by the Grace of God, through Jeſus Chriſt, he comes in this, and the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to engage them to their duty both to God and Man.

Altho the duty here exhorted to in the laſt Verſe, be ſo high, that it is not eaſie to reach unto it, <hi>viz. not to be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good;</hi> yet the conſideration of the <hi>mercies of God,</hi> mentioned above, will make this appear to be but a <hi>reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>

            <p>The point of Doctrine from this Text is,</p>

            </p>
            <p>We ſhall ſpeak a little to each of theſe in order, and make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of both together; which done, you will ſee, <hi>How we ought to do our duty towards others, tho they do not theirs towards us.</hi> I begin with the firſt:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Bran. Every Chriſtiaa ſhould take heed, that he be not overcome of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>evil,</hi> underſtand any unkind, or injurious dealing from others; which may be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By detaining, or withdrawing from us the love, or the fruits thereoſ, which by the will of God are due to us, either as men, or men ſtanding in ſuch, or ſuch a ſpecial Relation to them: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſpeaking, or doing that to us, or againſt us, which the Law of Love, or the ſpecial Relation wherein we ſtand unto them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be overcome of evil,</hi> is to be drawn by the evil Temper, or Carriage of another towards us, to be of the like Temper, and Carriage towards him: To be ſo provoked by an injury done unto us, as to return the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>As when two contraries are put together, ſuppoſe <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that which brings the other to its Temper, is ſaid to Maſter, and overcome it; ſo when another's malice towards us, cools our love to him, and brings us to the like evil diſpoſition towards him, our love may be ſaid to be overcome by his malice.</p>
            <p>And great reaſon there is, that we ſhould take heed, that we be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of evil.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider what Relicks of Corruption there are in good men. We live not among <hi>Angels,</hi> but men compaſſed about with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infirmities, which will be apt to make them ſometimes offenſive to us.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Seer</hi> came to <hi>Aſa</hi> with a Meſſage from God, becauſe it was that which did not pleaſe him, he was wroth, and in a rage with him,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 16.10</note> and put him in Priſon; a ſtrange act of a good King! yet ſo he was; for the Scripture teſtifies of him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.14.

            <p>Sin is a troubleſome thing, and will not ſuffer him in whom it is, to be at reſt, nor any that are near to it, or about it.</p>
            <p>One would think, That if any men in the world were like to have been free from diſturbing-paſſions, the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould be the men, whoſe <hi>Maſters</hi> taught and practiſed Meekneſs to that degree as no man ever did the like: yet we find, that ſuch as were brought up under their wings, had their infirmities, and diſturbing paſſions, as well as others. <hi>Joſhua, Moſes</hi> his Servant, hearing that <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in the Camp, is diſturbed himſelf, and endeavours to diſturb <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> about the matter, and would have had him diſturb them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.28. <hi>My Lord Moſes, forbid them:</hi> but he checks his paſſion, and calms his ſpirit, by wiſhing there were more of them: <hi>I would all the Lords people were prophets.</hi> The like you find in Chriſts own Diſciples, even in <hi>John,</hi> who lay in his boſom;<note place="margin">Mark 9.38.</note> he comes to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not us.</hi> They would have had Chriſt, it's like, joyn with them in the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but he forbids them to forbid him, ſaying, <hi>He that is not againſt us, is on our part.</hi> So that you ſee, you may find enough from good men, to exerciſe you ſo far, as to try the ſtrength of all your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides this, you will find in ſome a rooted enmity to that which is good. There are two Spirits, by one of which all the men in the World are led, <hi>the Spirit of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit which is of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. Theſe two Spirits being contrary one to the other, do lead two contrary ways. They have ſtriven long, and will ſtrive, as long as they breathe.</p>
            <p>The contrariety of theſe two Spirits, firſt appeared in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and hath continued down along thorough all Generations, unto this day, and will do ſo hereafter. It is like the War between <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 14.30.</note> all their days. The hatred of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is called by the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.15. <hi>the old hatred,</hi> not only becauſe they were alway full of ſpite againſt them; but becauſe it was of the ſame nature as that of old to the people of God.</p>
            <p>This old hatred is not like, by <hi>waxing old, to vaniſh away,</hi> as the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſaid to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13.

               </note> and that they were the Authors of all the Tumults in thoſe days, and what not? all manner of evil, but falſly; yet by this means, great perſecutions were raiſed againſt them: And if Chriſtians will be Chriſtians ſtill, they will find the World to be the World ſtill: ſo that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be the more careful, they will be in danger to be overcome of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. For if they find it hard ſometimes, not to be overcome of the <hi>leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> evil of good men, how will they not be overcome by the <hi>greater</hi> of bad men! <hi>If the footmen weary them, how will they contend with horſes?</hi> Jer. 12.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is ſomething in every man, that makes him more eaſie to be overcome. Malice, and other fooliſh and hurtful luſts, and roots of bitterneſs, that lye deep in the heart of every man by nature. You ſee how early they will be putting forth, even in Children themſelves. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is a Leſſon, that every child hath at his fingers end. The more to blame are they, who being converſant about them, do teach, and prompt them to uſe their hands to avenge themſelves on perſons or things, before they be able to uſe their tongues to that, or any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>And as they grow up, they live in them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. in <hi>malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</hi> This is found ſo common a thing among Men, that <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren thought it almoſt impoſſible, that he ſhould not hate them for the evil they had done to him. Therefore, when their Father was dead, they ſay, <hi>Joſeph will certainly requite us all the evil we did unto him,</hi> Gen. 50.15. And ſo it's like he might, if God had not taught him another Leſſon: <hi>But he giveth more grace,</hi> James 4.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing Grace is imperfect in the beſt of Men on Earth, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them to take heed, leſt they be overcome of evil. Grace, ſo far as they have it, makes them ſtrong; but the remainders of Corruption makes them weak. I have heard, that it hath been ſaid of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently holy man, That he had Grace enough for two men; yet upon ſome occaſions he was found not to have enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

            <p>This Leſſon was not much taught in old time. Our Saviour tells us, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were wont to teach the contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.43.

            <p>The like darkneſs had blinded the eyes of the old Philoſophers, for the moſt part. Some of them indeed, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> have excellent Precepts, tending toward the Point in hand; but theſe may be thought to light their Candle at their Neighbours Torch.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That we are to endeavour to overcome evil with good, doth appear by this.

As every godly man is in ſome meaſure like unto God, and every true Chriſtian, of Chriſt's mind and way; ſo he is to endeavour ſtill to be more like to both. Otherwiſe, to profeſs Godlineſs and Chriſtianity, is to take the Name of God and Chriſt in vain. The Name which God proclaimed
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:42587:239" rendition="simple:additions"/> as his, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. was, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> Theſe are Attributes which God delights to magnifie: He glories in this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. <hi>I am the Lord, which exerciſe loving-kindneſs.</hi> How often is it ſaid of him,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9.17. Joel 2.13. Jonah 4.2. Gen. 6.5.</note> That he is <hi>ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs?</hi> God did wonderfully exerciſe theſe his Attributes toward the old World. When the <hi>wickedneſs of man was great on the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil continually,</hi> how ſlow to anger was he then? He did not preſently ſend the Deluge, but his long-ſuffering is ſaid to wait, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.20. And this time of waiting was no leſs than One hundred and twenty years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. His loving-kindneſs appeared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in that he ſent <hi>Noah,</hi> who preached righteouſneſs, and called them all this while to repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. The like long-ſuffering, and great kindneſs, he exerciſed toward the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Bondage,</hi> from whence he delivered them, to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in that good Land, which he ſo freely gave them too. They were no ſooner brought miraculouſly through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> but they began to provoke; and not long after you may hear God complaining of them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.11. <hi>How long will this people provoke me?</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 22. he ſays, <hi>They have tempted me now theſe ten times:</hi> Nor were they better after this; for he was then grieved with them forty years long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10. After the ſame rate they carried it, when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> as you may ſee by reading the Hiſtorical Books of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> You have a ſhort ſum of the Kindneſſes of God to them, and their great Miſcarriages in the 9th <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Nehem.</hi>

The greatneſs of their ſin, and God's great goodneſs to them, are both ſet forth in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, a people that provoke me to anger continually to my face.</hi> Their ſin is here called Rebellion, which was not only once or twice, but continually, and that to his very face. And the goodneſs of God to them, is ſet out by the ſpreading out of his hands; which ſhewed great deſire of their coming in, and a readineſs to embrace them in ſo doing; and this is ſaid to be not once or twice, but all the day. That this Scripture is to be underſtood of the <hi>Jews,</hi> we have the Apoſtles Warrant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. To <hi>Iſrael he ſaith, All the day long have I ſtretched out my hand to a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and gain-ſaying people.</hi> Thus matters ſtood between God and them, <hi>all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9.

               <hi>if he thirſt, give him drink.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions carry more in them than a little bread and drink. When God is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. to make his Sun to ariſe on the evil and the good, and to ſend rain on the juſt, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; more is meant than the meer ſhining of the Sun, and the deſcending of the rain upon them: All earthly comforts which are produced by the Suns influence, and the fructifying vertue of the rain, are comprehended in them. So when you ask of God <hi>daily bread,</hi> in asking that, you ask all other neceſſaries for your life. In like manner, when God ſays, Give bread and drink, he intends any thing elſe that may do them good. Thus did <hi>Joſeph</hi> deal to his brethren, who had been very injurious to him;<note place="margin">Gen. 50.21.</note> when by the Providence of God he came to ſuch an eſtate, that he was able to do them good, he not only gave them bread in their hunger, but nouriſhed and comforted them, and was a ſhelter to them in a ſtrange Land, as long as he lived.</p>
            <p>As we ſhould do them all the good we can, ſo we ought to prevent any evil that might fall upon them. <hi>Saul</hi> had been very defective in his duty to <hi>David,</hi> both as a Prince, and a Father. As a Prince, he ought

But on the contrary, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourages ſome of his Followers to kill him, but endeavours to take away his life by his own hand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.1, 10. Now how doth <hi>David</hi> carry it in this caſe? He endeavours to ſave himſelf as well as he could, by withdrawing, and giving place to <hi>Saul</hi>'s wrath: And when he, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.6, 7. 1 Sam. 26.8, 9.</note> falls into his hands more than once, he doth not only not deſtroy him himſelf, but withholds thoſe that would. The tenderneſs that was in him toward ſuch an enraged Enemy, appeared in this, that his heart ſmote him but for cutting off the skirt of his Garment; tho this was done, only to ſhew that he was in his power, and that he could have done him a miſchief if he would. What effect this had upon <hi>Saul,</hi> may be ſeen in the Story. When <hi>David</hi> ſhewed him the skirt of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſpake a few words to ſhew his innocency, he, tho a King, and mightily enraged againſt him, is melted into tears, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16, 17. <hi>Saul lifted up his voice and wept,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt rewarded me good; whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</hi>

It was the Rule he gave to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 2.24. <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves; if God peradventure will give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> This was his own practiſe at this time: for <hi>ver.</hi> 7. he ſays, <hi>We were gentle among you, as a nurſe cheriſheth her children.</hi> As a Nurſe bears with the frowardneſs and peeviſhneſs of Children, and by all ways imaginable endeavours to quiet them, and bring them to a good humour; ſo did the Apoſtle with them. And it is probable, that thoſe of them that did believe, partly by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Doctrine, and partly by his Example, were of the like diſpoſition and carriage toward them that believed not. And what the effect of this was, in that place where the Goſpel was ſo much oppoſed at firſt, we may gather from what he ſays in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have a free courſe, and be glorified, even as it is with you.</hi>

When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he preacht the Goſpel among them for two whole years together, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.30, 31.

            <p n="2">2. If you find them ſometimes to have a farther reach, and to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond time, to eternity; you muſt conſider, they were extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by the ſpirit of Propheſie did foreſee what God had irrevocably determined concerning ſome men; and upon this ſuppoſition they might not only acquieſce in the judgment of God againſt them, but were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to approve of it too.

That theſe had ſuch a foreſight, is plain, by what <hi>David</hi> ſpake of <hi>Judas</hi> many years before he was born. He ſaw plainly what <hi>Judas</hi> his curſed end would be, as you may ſee by reading the 109th <hi>Pſalm;</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, the Holy Ghoſt ſpake before concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>David,</hi> Acts 1.16. So that theſe, being Perſons and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes extraordinary, are not to be drawn into example by ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>It is good for us to mind what Chriſt ſays of great ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31, 32. <hi>I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</hi> When Chriſt ſays, <hi>all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men,</hi> and excepts none but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; no, not a word ſpoken againſt the Son of Man himſelf; we may well think, a word ſpoken, or a deed done againſt our ſelves, may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that it may be ſo, ſhould pray for it, and we may hope fot a good effect of it.<note place="margin">Acts 7.60.</note> 
               <hi>Stephen</hi>'s prayer, when he was ſtoned, probably had an influence on <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion. St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin, which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death.</hi> So that unleſs a Man could be aſſured, that another hath ſinned that ſin which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, he may, nay, he ought to pray for him: <hi>He ſhall ask,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In any caſe where there is but an <hi>if ſo be,</hi> or a <hi>who can tell,</hi> or a <hi>perhaps,</hi> there is room left for prayer. In that mighty Tempeſt that aroſe in the Sea to arreſt <hi>Jonah,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> which was like to have broken the Ship; he is called on to ariſe, and call upon his God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.6. <hi>If ſo be that God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</hi> Their caſe was very doubtful, yet they pray.</p>
            <p>So when <hi>Jonah</hi> had delivered his Meſſage to the <hi>Ninevites, Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be overthrown;</hi> they cry mightily unto God, ſaying, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn, and repent?</hi> Jonah 3.9. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was in a very bad ſtate, <hi>In the gall of bitterneſs, and the bond of iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> perceived it;<note place="margin">Si fieri poſſit, ab ipſis inferis extrahendi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſunt homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Calvinus</hi> in locum.</note> yet he bids him repent, and pray, <hi>If perhaps</hi> the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven him; and can we think, that he who put him upon praying for himſelf, would not pray for him too, eſpecially conſidering <hi>Simon</hi> requeſted it of him? <hi>Acts</hi> 8.21, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third good means to be uſed to overcome evil in others, is to uſe good words in ſpeaking,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of</hi> them, 2. <hi>To</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſpeak well <hi>of</hi> them, ſo far as with truth we may. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> thinks this is required, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Bleſs them that perſecute you; bleſs and curſe not:</hi> Where, by <hi>bleſſing,</hi> in the the former part of the verſe, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, ſpeaking well of them in the latter, praying for them. But poſſibly the Apoſtle might double the word, only for the greater <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> it being a duty of great neceſſity, and not eaſie to be performed. However, it muſt be acknowledged a duty to ſpeak well of them, for
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:42587:242" rendition="simple:additions"/> what is praiſe-worthy in them. Indeed we may not call evil good, nor praiſe any for the evil they do; but muſt ſay in that caſe, as the Apoſtle doth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.22. <hi>Shall I praiſe you in this? I praiſe you not.</hi> On the other hand, we muſt not call good evil. There being none ſo bad, but have ſome good gifts, and commendable qualities in them; we ſhould acknowledg them in them, and praiſe them for them. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of the <hi>Ninth Commandment,</hi> requires this at our hands, to <hi>bear a true witneſs</hi> to our Neighbour. Therefore, as Chriſt, when he blames this, and the other Church, for the faults he found in them, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the good he found among them, ſaying to one, <hi>This thou haſt;</hi> and to another, <hi>This thou haſt,</hi> Rev. 2.6. and 3.4. ſo ſhould we do. And how this tends to overcome evil, the Wiſe-man will tell us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.21. <hi>As the fining pot for ſilver, and the furnace for gold, ſo is a man to his praiſe:</hi> or, as others, <hi>ſo is to a man his praiſe:</hi> That is, it tries him, and refines him too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As good words <hi>of</hi> them, tend to overcome evil in others, ſo good words <hi>to</hi> them. Reſpectful language, and modeſt anſwers, are of great efficacy to allay and abate corrupt affections in others. It was ſpiritual wiſdom in <hi>Paul</hi> to anſwer <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaying, he was mad and beſides himſelf, calmly and reſpectfully, <hi>I am not mad, moſt noble Feſtus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26.25.</note> With what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence doth <hi>David</hi> ſpeak of, and to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him for his life? Speaking of him, he calls him the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.16. and ſpeaking to him, he doth, as it were, in one breath (for 'tis within the compaſs of the Three following verſes), call him, <hi>My Lord the King.</hi> And what he ſpake, as well as what he did at that time, did for the preſent mollifie his heart towards him, as appears by his ſaying to him again, <hi>Is this thy voice, my ſon David? By long forbearing a Prince is perſwaded, and a ſoft tongue breaketh the bone.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25.15.</note> A Flint is ſooner broken on a Pillow than on a Rock. We find the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> very angry with <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 8.1. becauſe he called them not, when he went out againſt the <hi>Midianites:</hi> for the Text ſaith, <hi>they did chide with him ſharply.</hi> He, tho a <hi>mighty man of valour,</hi> gave them this modeſt anſwer, <hi>What have I now done in compariſon of you? Is not the gleaning of the graves of Ephraim, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the vintage of Abiezer?</hi> Intimating, that they had done greater ſervice in purſuing, than he had done in routing of them. <hi>Then,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>their anger was abated toward him, when he had ſaid that.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15.1.</note> Grievous words might have ſtirred up anger, but his ſoft anſwer turned away wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third thing propoſed, was, to ſhew the <hi>manner,</hi> how all this good muſt be done, that it may be the more effectual. It muſt be done,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Cordially:</hi> What you do, muſt be done as in the preſence of him by whom <hi>actions are weighed.</hi> Your prayers muſt not come out of <hi>feigned lips.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.3. Pſal. 17.1. 2 Cor. 2.17.</note> What you ſpeak, muſt be <hi>as in the ſight of God.</hi> It is eaſie to uſe a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental words, in ſpeaking to Men; or a few vain words in ſpeaking to God for them, as all are that come not from the heart. When you are about
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:42587:243" rendition="simple:additions"/> this work, you ſhould endeavour to draw deep, even from the bottom of your hearts. <hi>Paul</hi> calls his prayer for the <hi>Jews,</hi> his greateſt enemies, <hi>his hearts deſire, Rom.</hi> 10.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Readily. Titus</hi> is charged to put Chriſtians in mind of this, <hi>To be ready to every good work,</hi> Tit. 3.1. Altho theſe good works be contrary to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, Grace will make a Man ready to them. The holieſt Men have been alway the moſt forward in them. When God had ſet that Mark of his diſpleaſure on <hi>Miriam,</hi> for chiding with <hi>Moſes,</hi> how ready was he to pray for her! <hi>Moſes cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, Heal her now, O God, I beſeech thee, Numb.</hi> 12.13. The <hi>Jews,</hi> before the Captivity, were grown to a height of wickedneſs, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>They mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his word, and miſuſed his prophets;</hi> and among the reſt, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> in particular, who was ſent to tell them of the approaching <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:</hi> yet he was far from deſiring that evil to overtake them, tho they ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Where is the word of the Lord? let it come now.</hi> He appeals to God in the next verſe, That he had not deſired the <hi>woful day.</hi> He was ſo far from that, that he prayed hard for that hard-hearted people. How his heart ſtood this way, you may ſee by Gods telling him again and again, that he ſhould not pray for them: <hi>Pray not thou for this people,</hi> Jer. 7.16. So again, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.14. and once more, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.11. till he tells him at laſt, <hi>tho Moſes and Samuel ſtood before him, yet his mind could not be toward that people,</hi> chap. 15.1.</p>
            <p>Such an admirable readineſs was found in the Man of God, againſt whom <hi>Jeroboam ſtretched</hi> out his hand, ſaying, <hi>lay hold on him,</hi> for his crying in the Name of the Lord, againſt his idolatrous Altar at <hi>Bethel.</hi> God had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up that hand which he ſtretched forth againſt the Prophet, which brought him to intreat the Man of God to pray for him; <hi>And the man of God beſought the Lord, and the Kings hand was reſtored again, and became as it was before,</hi> 1 Kings 13.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſtantly.</hi> It is not enough to uſe theſe means once or twice, for a fit, or when you are in a better frame than ordinary; but it muſt be your conſtant courſe. You find that when your bodies are full of evil Humors, the uſe of a good Medicine once or twice doth not remove your Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; therefore you ſteer to a courſe of Phyſick. So muſt you do to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or alter the tough Humors that may be in others; you muſt uſe the Means conſtantly. There muſt not only be a well-doing, but a <hi>patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi> in it.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.7. Gal. 6.9.</note> If you find no good effect for a while, <hi>be not weary</hi> of well-doing: <hi>Say not, I will recompence evil, but wait on the Lord,</hi> Prov. 20.22. Thus did <hi>David</hi> for a long time, when <hi>Saul</hi> was his enemy; he waited on the Lord, and kept his way, tho he was put to many a hard ſhift the while. And God put a ſweet ſong into his mouth at laſt, when he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of the hands of all his enemies, and the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> Pſal. 18.20, 21. <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of my hands hath he recompenced me; for I have kept the ways of the Lord.</hi>

And O that we could ſay, that ſuch as make a greater profeſſion than others, and are in moſt things of good and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Converſations, were altogether free in this matter! But this evil is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical;</hi> and the beſt, I fear, are too much infected with it. The ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this we partly ſee already, and may ſee more in time, if God in Mercy prevent them not. So that it is for a lamentation, and like to be for a lamentation.</p>
            <p>Uſe 2. <hi>Look about you, and take heed that you be not overcome of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let not imaginary evils overcome you, as they will be like to do, as well as thoſe that are real, if they be ſo apprehended. There is no obſerving man, but may ſee what miſchief hath come heretofore, and doth come eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day by ſuch. There always have been, and ſtill are ſome, who beings weak or malicious, do go about telling ſtories of this and that Man, or Party; and by leaving out, or putting into their tale ſome circumſtances, or by ſetting an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> upon a word innocently ſpoken, do raiſe in others the higheſt Paſſions, which hurry them away to ſpeak and do things very ſinful and unjuſt.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.</note> If <hi>Doeg</hi> had fairly repreſented the matter of <hi>Abimelech</hi>

            <p>If <hi>David,</hi> upon hearing what <hi>Ziba</hi> had told him of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> had ſtaid a while, and heard what he could have ſaid for himſelf, he would not ſo ſoon have forgot the <hi>paſſing love</hi> of <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Father, nor the Oath he made to him,<note place="margin">2 S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>not to cut off kindneſs from his houſe for ever.</hi> But being then in ſuch Circumſtances as made him credulous, upon a feigned ſtory; without more ado, he preſently gave away all that belonged to poor <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi> to that falſe Man. And how many that are, or would eaſily be made very good Friends, are ſeparated, or kept at a diſtance at this day, by ſuch means as theſe; he is a ſtranger to the World that doth not ſee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the evil be real, yet be not overcome by it. It may be it is not ſo great as it is apprehended: But if it be, it may be the Author of it did not think it would prove ſo offenſive, and hard to be born, as you find it to be; and then it would be a greater evil in you to return that to another which you find ſo hard to be born your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould be more ready to receive one injury after another, than to return one for another. This I take to be the meaning of Chriſt, When he ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, did blaſphemouſly object againſt Chriſt, that he did not obſerve his own Laws; becauſe when he was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by one of the Offenders with the palm of his hand, he did not turn the other cheek, but did expoſtulate with him that did it, in theſe words, <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil; but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> John 18.23. But Chriſt is the beſt Interpreter of his own Laws; and by his practiſe hath told us what his meaning was in this. He was ſo far from avenging himſelf by word or deed, that he was ready and prepared to ſuffer farther at their hands; ſo as not only to be ſmitten again, but to be crucified. And in this he is propoſed to us, as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps. Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; Who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Will not ſuch as are injurious, grow more inſolent, and go from bad to worſe, if they be not dealt withal in their own kind?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If any have humanity or ingenuity in them, they will be aſhamed by your forbearing of them; if they be void of theſe, they will be more irritated and provoked, by rendring evil for their evil; and conſequently, you are like to endure more from them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:42587:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. If they ſhould go from bad to worſe, yet you may not avenge your ſelves: This were to take upon you to be Judges in your own Caſe. God hath ſet up the Ordinance of Magiſtracy for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> Therefore in greater injuries you are to make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him for a Compenſation; as <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Acts 25.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Altho a private perſon may not avenge himſelf, yet in caſe he be aſſaulted by another that would take away his life; if no Magiſtrate be at hand, he may ſtand upon his own defence by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which Chriſt came not to deſtroy: Provided,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.33, 34.</note> that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid his Adverſary, by flying, if he may. But if he preſs ſo hard upon him, that he cannot, he may defend himſelf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhould be as willing to ſave the others life, as to preſerve his own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God himſelf, when other means ſail, doth often appear to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the wrongs of ſuch as ſuffer with meekneſs and patience. He will not ſtand by as one unconcerned, eſpecially if his Name be intereſted in the matter. When <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he made a railing Oration to the People, threatning what be would do; but they anſwer him <hi>not a word:</hi> for the King had ſaid, <hi>Anſwer him not,</hi> Iſa. 36.21. A while after <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himſelf receives a Letter, ſtuft with the like railing matter: he reads it, but turns from the Meſſenger, and goes to the Houſe of God; and ſpreading the Letter before the Lord, leaves the matter with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.14. <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord went forth, and ſmote in the camp of the Aſſyrians, One hundred and fourſcore and five thouſand,</hi> ver. 36.</p>
            <p>God commanded <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to put a Yoke upon his neck, as a ſign, That the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be brought under the Yoke of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 27.2, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Hananiah,</hi> a falſe Prophet, comes and takes the Yoke off his neck,<note place="margin">Jer. 28.10.</note> and breaks it before his face. What doth the good Prophet do the while? Doth he ſtrive with him about the Yoke, that he might not break it? Or doth he uſe any undecent words when be had done it? No: 'tis ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Jeremiah went his way:</hi> but God ſent him to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniah</hi> with this Meſſage; That for his Rebellion he ſhould die that Year; which accordingly came to paſs in the ſeventh Month, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians that would keep a due <hi>Decorum</hi> in their words and actions when they are injured, ſhould look well to their hearts, and keep them with diligence; for all ſinful Miſcarriages begin there. When the heart is diſordered by corrupt Affections, the tongue, and other Members, will hardly be kept many good order.<note place="margin">Corfelle livoris amarum, per linguae inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, niſi ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra non poteſt, <hi>Bernardus.</hi>
               </note> Therefore the Apoſtle willing the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians</hi> to put off the evil of the tongue, <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> which is evil-ſpeaking, bids them firſt put off the evils of the heart, <hi>anger and malice,</hi> chap. 3.8. Whether the heart be inditing a good, or a bad matter, the tongue will be as the pen of a ready-writer. If Choler be ſuffered to boil to a height in the heart, the ſcum will be like to run over at the mouth. If the heart
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:42587:245" rendition="simple:additions"/> be as the the troubled Sea,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.20.</note> which cannot reſt, it will be caſting out the mire and dirt which before lay at the bottom.<note place="margin">Nullum vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae genus tam in promptu ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, quam hoc maledicendi, <hi>Davenantius. Prov. 25.28.</hi>
               </note> The evil of the heart is uſually vented firſt at the mouth; but it will ſoon appear in the other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. When once the <hi>mouth</hi> is full of curſing and bitterneſs, the <hi>feet</hi> will be ſwift to ſhed blood, till deſtruction and miſery be in mens ways, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. He that will not be overcome of evil, muſt take care to rule his own ſpirit: <hi>He that hath no rule over his own ſpirit, is like to a city broken down, and without walls;</hi> eaſily overcome. Nothing can conduce more to the calming of our ſpirits, when they begin to riſe againſt ſuch as are offenſive to us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.10. Pſal. 130.3. 2 Sam. 16.6, 7, 10.</note> than to conſider how obnoxious we have been, and ſtill are to the great God. <hi>David</hi>'s patience towards <hi>Shimei</hi> was admirable, when he <hi>caſt ſtones</hi> at him, and <hi>curſed</hi> him ſtill as he went. No doubt the conſideration of the ſins whereby he had provoked God, made him the more calm toward that vile wretch.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. <hi>Reſt not in this, That you are not overcome of evil; but endeavour, as much as you can, to overcome evil with good.</hi> Do not your Relations perform the duties of their place to you? be you the more circumſpect and diligent to perform the duty of yours to them. Are Neighbours unkind to you? let the law of kindneſs be in your mouth, and acts of kindneſs in your hands to them.<note place="margin">Vis ut ameris? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Keep your hearts in a conſtant awe of God commanding you. When they draw back, as they will be apt to do, think of God ſtanding by you, and ſaying, <hi>Have not I commanded you?</hi> If others make no great matter of ſinning againſt God, do you ſay, as <hi>Nehemiah, But ſo will not I, becauſe of the fear of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 5.15.</note> This was it that kept <hi>Samuel</hi> to the duty of praying for a people that had dealt very unworthily by him: <hi>As for me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.24.</note> 
               <hi>in ceaſing to pray for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Have much and often in your eye, the great example of all goodneſs, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe name you bear. He met with a great deal of evil from an unthankful World: yet he went about doing good ſtill, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. How kind was he in word and deed to his greateſt enemies to the very laſt. When <hi>Judas</hi> came to betray him, the worſt word he gave him was, <hi>Friend, Mat.</hi> 26.50. <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</hi> And when <hi>Peter,</hi> in zeal for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's ſafety, had drawn, and cut off the ear of one of the Officers that came to take him, <hi>he touched his ear, and healed him,</hi> Luke 22.51. Conſider him therefore <hi>who endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>leſt ye be wearied, and faint in your minds.</hi> If he whom you call Lord and Maſter, did thus, ſhould not you do ſo much rather?</p>
            <p>To further you in this work, take theſe few Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By doing thus, you will ſhew your ſelves to be genuine Chriſtians, and truly ſpiritual.<note place="margin">Jam. 3.14, 15.</note> To render evil for evil, is deviliſh; good for good, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing humane, but no more than <hi>Publicans</hi> uſed to do: but to render good for evil, that is Chriſtian. <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> Mat. 5.46. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is in all, goodneſs,</hi> Eph. 5.9. If then there be found in you ſuch fruits of the Spirit as are mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Love, joy, peate, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. it will be a token, that the good Spirit of Chriſt is in you.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="571" facs="tcp:42587:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. It will tend very much to amplifying of the Kingdom of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Haec illa virtus eſt, qua primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva eccleſia excelluit, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crevit ferendo, non reſiſtendo, ad hanc quia redditi ſumus inhabiles res Chriſtianiſmi in deterius ruunt in dies, <hi>Aretius. 2 Cor. 13.11.</hi>
               </note> and the bettering of the World. One great reaſon why Chriſtianity hath made no greater progreſs in the world in latter times is, becauſe Chriſtians have not been ſo much converſant in this duty, as they were in the Primitive times. The rendring evil for evil, makes the World a doleful place; an houſe, a <hi>Bedlam</hi> for fury and diſorder: A City, a Wilderneſs for rapine and confuſion: A Kingdom, a Land that eateth up the Inhabitants thereof; as was ſaid of that, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.32. But to render good for evil, tends to make the World a peaceable habitation, where God and Men may delight to dwell. If this duty were more practiſed, the Wolf would ſooner dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard lie down with the Kid, as is propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's a ſign that God hath more bleſſings in ſtore, when he hath given a Man a heart to perform this duty. His <hi>labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> Beſides the eternal reward in Heaven, God doth uſually give a temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on earth. There is this encouragement given to afford bread to an hungry enemy, That God will reward it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21, 22. <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets when he preſaged good to <hi>David</hi> for not ſuffering him to be hurt when his Spear was taken from him, while he lay ſleeping, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Bleſſed be thou, my ſon David; thou ſhalt both do great things, and alſo ſhall ſtill prevail.</hi> It hath been obſerved, That ſuch children as have been, without cauſe, diſcouraged by their parents, ſo as not to have a like ſhare in their favour, nor a portion of their ſubſtance with the reſt, and yet have continued every way dutiful to them, have been bleſt by God above the reſt. And ſuch Servants as have had hard and froward Maſters, and yet have continued diligent and faithful in their Service, have been wonderfully proſpered when they have ſet up for themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is the moſt glorious way of overcoming others. It's God's, and Chriſt's way, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew them with cords of a man, with hands of love.</hi> What glory would it be to a man, that it ſhould be ſaid of him, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed cities,</hi> if he himſelf be in the mean time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by his own luſts? <hi>To be ſlow to anger is better than the mighty;</hi>

               <hi>and he that ruleth his own ſpirit, than he that taketh a city,</hi> Prov. 16.32.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hereby you will keep a ſweet ſerenity in your own ſpirits. There is not only glory and honour, but peace to every one that worketh good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. How was <hi>David</hi> tranſported with joy, when <hi>Abigail</hi> had been a means of keeping him from avenging himſelf with his own hand on <hi>Nabal</hi> and his houſe? His mouth was full of bleſſings: He <hi>bleſſeth</hi> the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſent her; he <hi>bleſſeth</hi> her advice, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. Much more joy will flow in upon you, if you go farther, and overcome evil with good. You will bleſs God heartily, who hath enabled you, againſt all temptations, and your own natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary, to perform this excellent and moſt Chriſtian duty, when you find in your ſelves the joy that will attend it.</p>

            <p>The ſteps I ſhall go by are theſe, ſhewing you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What Duty is, in the general nature and notion of it. 'Tis an Act of Obedience to the will of our Superiors. God being our Soveraign Supreme Lord, Maſter and Lawgiver, our duty lies in ſubjecting our ſelves in all things to his will. Duty is that which is due from Man to God: 'Tis

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Deum, Gic. de Nat. de lib.</hi> 1. 'Tis Juſtice towards God: We don't do God right, we rob him of his glory, if we don't do our duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God knows indeed, how to recover his right; and the wrong we do in ſinning againſt him, will in the end redound to our own ſouls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. Every ſinner deals injuriouſly with God: he does not give unto God the things that are Gods; he withholds the obedience that is due unto God; he will not be ſubject to his Law; he does not do his duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Something is our preſent duty. God hath filled up all our time with duty; not one Moment left at our own diſpoſal: We muſt give an account to him of every thing we do in the body, from firſt to laſt; every day hath its proper works, the things of it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.34.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nothing that is ſinful, and in it ſelf unlawful, can be our duty at any time; and therefore, to be ſure, not our preſent duty. This needs no proof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every thing that is in it ſelf-lawful, is not therefore our duty: <hi>All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.12. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not forbidden under a penalty, is lawful; <hi>i. e.</hi> whatſoever is not contrary to the rectitude of the Law, and in the doing of which, we incur no penalty from the Law, that is lawful; but nothing properly is our duty, but what is commanded: What we have a command to do, or not to do, the doing, or not doing of that, is our duty, as the command runs in the Affirmative, or Negative. The Law ſtrictly injoyns ſome things, does tollerate and allow of ſome others of a more indifferent nature, which <hi>in intimo gradu-juris,</hi> in the loweſt degree of legality, may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful; and yet Circumſtances may render our doing theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, when God is not glorified, nor our Neighbour edified: <hi>All things edifie not,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every thing that is commanded, and is in its time and place our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may not be our preſent duty. Affirmative commands do bind <hi>ſemper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> as Negatives do: Affirmatives bind always; <hi>i. e.</hi> we can never be diſcharged from that obligation that lies upon us to worſhip God; but we are not bound at all times to the outward acts of worſhip; for then me ſhould do nothing elſe: Neither indeed are we bound at all times to inward acts of worſhip: for in our ſleep we do not act our Grace: A diſpoſition ſo to do from an inward habit and principle, is all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, when we are not in a capacity to act either Grace or Reaſon. — Beſides, poſitive commands muſt give place to a moral duty, becauſe they will not juſtifie our neglect of that. Hence on the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> we may and ought to lift our Neighbours Ox out of the pit, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.5. and to perform any other act of neceſſary charity, notwithſtanding that poſitive command to worſhip God upon that day.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That which God now requires of you, and in doing of which you may moſt glorifie God, and edifie your Neighbour, that is undoubtedly your preſent duty.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall we know this?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="575" facs="tcp:42587:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Always look within your Calling for your preſent duty; for there it lies. Don't go beyond your line. Do your own buſineſs, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11. We have different gifts, and different talents, according to the Grace that is given unto us. Let every one attend to that which God hath fitted him for, and called him to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>The wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way,</hi> Prov. 14.8. God hath appointed to every one his way of living in this World, from the <hi>Smith that blows the coals,</hi> Iſa. 54.16. to the King that ſins upon the Throne. That cannot be our duty which we are not called to. We are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lords, to do what we liſt: No, we are under command, and muſt obey. <hi>I am one in authority,</hi> ſays the <hi>Centurion, I ſay unto my ſervant, do this, and he doth it,</hi> Luke 7.8. God hath the Supreme Authority over us: We ought not to move one ſtep but by his direction.</p>
            <p>Our Calling is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>General.</hi> As we are Chriſtians, ſo all Saints are of the ſame Calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. <hi>called to be ſaints.</hi> We are all equally obliged to the duties of our Chriſtian Calling, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſerve and worſhip God, to believe in him, to love and fear him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Particular:</hi> So we differ in our Callings: Some are called to the Magiſtracy, ſome to the Miniſtry; ſome are Maſters, ſome Servants; ſome called to this, ſome to that Trade, or Occupation.</p>
            <p>We are called to Chriſtianity by the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We are called to ſome outward worldly Calling, by God's ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in his Law. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work,</hi> Exod. 20.9. Every man hath <hi>his</hi> work; a full buſineſs which he muſt not neglect: He muſt do all <hi>his</hi> work. They walk diſorderly who work not at all, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>living in pleaſures and wantonneſs,</hi> Jam. 5.5. having nothing to do. Let all idle voluptuous Gallants conſider this, who ſpend their days in mirth and jollity, ſcorn the thought of buſineſs; they muſt needs be far from their preſent duty, who are imploy'd in nothing, or that which is worſe than nothing.</p>
            <p>We are called to this or that Imployment by Providence. That we ſhould be of ſome Calling, is from the Word; that we are of this, or that Calling, is from Providence. Providence follows the Word, and is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that, ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>Much of the duties of our Chriſtian Calling, do follow us into our particular Callings; as duties of worſhip muſt be performed in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies every day, let our particular Calling be what it will. So the ſame Graces muſt be exerciſed in our particular Callings, which were required in our general Callings: The ſame Graces do follow us into our particular Callings, and into all the works of our hands.</p>
            <p>They who do not keep up duties of worſhip in their Families, will be as remiſs in all duties of practical holineſs in their lives. They who are not frequent in prayer, are never eminent in holineſs. And as no acts of worſhip, publick or private, do pleaſe God, that are not performed in Faith, and in the fear of God; So no common acts of our lives are pleaſing to God, if not done in Faith, and ſeaſoned with that inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:42587:248" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Grace that belongs to all the common actions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>In ſhewing you your preſent duty in your particular callings, I ſhall not inſiſt ſo much upon duties of worſhip; you know 'em, That Prayer, reading the Scriptures, Meditation, and diſcourſe of what you hear out of the Word, are all duties; and you know when they ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Morning and Evening, and as oft as your neceſſary occaſions will permit: Whether you do them, I muſt leave that to God, and your own Conſciences — But the preſent duty I would fix you in, is that of Practical Holineſs, which is your conſtant duty every moment of the day. I would clear up this to you, and ſhew you <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>where it lies,</hi> that if it be the will of God, you may be always found in it.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, That your preſent duty lies in a preſent exerciſe of Grace, ſuitable to the preſent work and buſineſs in all its circumſtances which you are at any time imploy'd in. If you buy or ſell, it muſt be in the fear of God; if you marry, it muſt be in the Lord. <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whatſoever you do,</hi> you muſt do it to <hi>Gods glory;</hi> which cannot be, if you do not act Grace in every thing you do. The true Goſpel-holineſs of an action, lies in that Grace that goes along with it. 'Tis Grace only that turns an action Heaven ward, and God-ward; you have no other way to ſence your ſelves from the temptations, ſnares and ſins that border upon all the works of your calling, but by keeping your ſelves in a due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace, being in the <hi>fear of God all the day long, that is the way to eſchew evil, and to do good;</hi> 'tis the <hi>beginning of wiſdom.</hi> He acts like a Fool who acts without it. The <hi>fear of God</hi> in Scripture, is put for all the Graces of the Spirit; and in that ſenſe I now preſs it upon you.</p>
            <p>You ſee your preſent duty lies in your preſent work, in the daily buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your particular callings. I ſuppoſe your callings are lawful, that there are no <hi>Stage-players, Conjurers, Diviners, Aſtrologers</hi> here. Thoſe who are of ſuch callings, their duty is to leave them, and to betake themſelves to ſome honeſt Imployment conſiſtent with Grace; and then Grace will help you out in it wonderfully. I could name ſome other callings that I would hardly adviſe a Chriſtian to — But whatever lawful Calling you are of, whatever Office you bear, whatever Relation you ſtand in, as Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Maſters, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; whatever your Trade, Occupation, or Imployment is, there are particular Duties proper to your Callings, which cannot be performed but by a ſuitable exerciſe of Grace, by which you ſhew the reſpect you have to God, in doing what you do, regulating and moderating your ſelves, and all your actions, by that rule of the Word. You may do the works of your calling, and yet not do the duties of your calling; if you ſeek only your ſelves, your own profit, pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is not to ſerve God, but your ſelves. You muſt do what you do, in Faith, as to the Lord; and then every thing you do, will be an act of worſhip,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:42587:248" rendition="simple:additions"/> becauſe it carries in it a religious reſpect to the will of God. Herein lies the nature of all Practical Holineſs, to do every thing after a godly ſort; whatever you are doing, be ſure you be in the exerciſe of ſome Grace. There can be no Godlineſs without Grace. Grace in exerciſe, conſiſts in the gracious actings of a holy ſoul, ſuitable to the matter or occaſion that is before us, for the exerciſe of ſuch or ſuch a Grace. Or thus— Grace in exerciſe, lies in the various emanations of ſpiritual life, ſhewing it ſelf in ſuitable and ſeaſonable actings, as the matter requires. The Spirit of God dwelling in Believers, hath a hand in every thing they do, as Saints, and doth ſhape himſelf in 'em, into that frame, into thoſe holy paſſions and affections that may beſt become a Saint in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Spirit does act theſe things in and by our ſouls, makes uſe of our faculties, lets out himſelf through our hearts, makes us to act ſo and ſo. The Spirit is ſaid to cry <hi>Abba, father,</hi> becauſe it makes us to do ſo. For inſtance, If the matter between God and a Soul, be ſin, the Spirit works Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, for our juſtification and pardon; works repentance and humiliation, brings us to ſelf-denial, in order to the mortification of ſin in our hearts and lives. If the matter be any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful buſineſs that we are called to, in the place and relation we ſtand in, the Spirit directs us how to do it in the beſt manner, ſo as God may be moſt glorified. Grace in the heart guides the hand. The heart is the ſeat of all affections. The Spirit knows that man will act ſo or ſo, as he ſtands affected; and therefore the Spirit ſets the affections right for God, works in the heart a true love to God, a holy fear of God, a zeal for his glory. Theſe gracious diſpoſitions towards God, follow a Saint into all his Imployments, inclining him to holineſs in all his ways.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Do you Miniſters take upon you to tell us what we muſt do in our Callings? We have ſerved an Apprentiſhip, and know better than you what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to our buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> —Miſtake me not; for the myſtery of your Craft, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, I meddle not with that: God has left you to your own reaſon and underſtanding, and ſo do I: The directions I give you, relate only to the religious manner of doing what you do; tho I muſt tell you, it is God that inſtructs you to diſcretion in all worldly buſineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.26. Whatever your skill and inſight is in your calling, prayer may make you wiſer: you may obtain a more excellent ſpirit in your way, than you now have, if you ſeek it of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.31, 32. Tho you are left to the uſe of your reaſon, as men, yet Faith muſt go along with it, as you are Chriſtians. Therefore I ſhall ſhew you how to put forth an act of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Faith.</p>
            <p>Some think they are never to make uſe of Faith, but when Reaſon fails them. 'Tis true, in ſuch caſes Faith is of ſingular uſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> found it ſo; yet God expects that in the ordinary courſe of our lives, in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matters that paſs thorow our Hands, Reaſon and Faith ſhould go together; for both have their diſtinct parts in all our ordinary underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings:
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:42587:249" rendition="simple:additions"/> And Faith is always Superior to Reaſon: Reaſon is fubſervient to that, as a hand-maid, putting forth its utmoſt ſtrength in all humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſtill leaving room for Faith, to deal with God for a bleſſing, that all may iſſue well at laſt.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How may we know when Reaſon and Faith go together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When at our entrance upon any buſineſs, we ſeek wiſdom and underſtanding from God, ſtirring up our Reaſon by our Faith, looking up to him from whom comes every good and perfect gift, that he would inſtruct us unto diſcretion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When in anſwer to Faith and Prayer, thoughts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o come in that clear up our way to us, and do put us into a right method, pointing out ſuch probable means, inclining to ſuch appoſite counſels, as in a rational way tend to the expediting that buſineſs we are about. In this caſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon owes its light to Faith, and aſcribes all its skill and diſcerning to God, who opens the eyes of our Natural Underſtandings, and cauſes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Man to move aright, in giving a true judgment of what is before us. Such a one can ſay, <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong. 'Tis not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that ſheweth mercy: Therefore let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength; but only in this, That he knows me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When under the greateſt aſſurances of our own Reaſon, we yet live in a humble dependance upon God, for ſucceſs, knowing that God can come between us and our Reaſon, and diſappoint us: He can diſ-joynt our councils, and let in his own will upon us, when we have laid things never ſo well together: God can ſpy a flaw in the beſt humane contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, to overthrow all; he can ſmite us between the joynts and the harneſs, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34. and give us a mortal wound, when we think we are ſhot-free. Thus does God ſometimes fruſtrate all mans prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, turning his wiſdom into fooliſhneſs, diſappointing him in the height of his expectation; he looks for good, and behold evil comes: he puts forth an act of Reaſon in Faith, who truſts to God, and not to his own Reaſon. 'Tis our duty to make uſe of it as men, tho as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians we ought not to truſt in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider preſent Providences. Tho 'tis Precept, not Providence, that makes Duty; yet Providence points to Duty, to the time and ſeaſon of it. Much of our duty lies in complying with the opportunity and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that Providence gives for the doing of this or that good work: to every thing there is a ſeaſon, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>and every thing is beautiful in his time,</hi> ver. 11. The beauty of holineſs lies in timing our duties aright. The godly man bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Heb. 6.7. <hi>meet fruit; i. e.</hi> appoſite fruit, fruit well-placed. What is done out of its place and proper ſeaſon, is not ſo comely and beautiful. Do good as you have opportunity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9, 10. If we would reap in due ſeaſon, we muſt ſow in due ſeaſon. There is a ſit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:42587:249" rendition="simple:additions"/> for both. We are never more obliged to our duty, than when we have the fitteſt opportunity to perform it: and we muſt eye providence in this: 'Tis the Prerogative of God to appoint times and ſeaſons, not only for his own purpoſes, but for our duty: He appoints the day, and the things of the day, what, and when it ſhall be done. Should you order a Servant to do a buſineſs to day, and he ſhould not do it till the next day, would you not count ſuch an one, a diſobedient Servant, becauſe he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not your time?</p>
            <p>Thoſe in the Goſpel (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3, 4.) came into the Vineyard at the ſame hour they were called. They who were called at one hour, did not come in at another hour. A call of God to repentance, loſes much of its efficacy, if it be not preſently complied with; the heart is hardened under it. 'Tis true, God can renew his call; but the firſt is quite loſt, if it be not preſently obey'd; <hi>ſtraightway they left their nets, and followed him,</hi> Mat. 4.20, 22. This was a converting call. There are many calls to converſion that are not converting calls: Man calls in God's Name; but till God ſpeak inwardly to the heart, all the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the world cannot prevail with a ſinner to come to Chriſt. Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace is a ſpecial Providence towards the Elect. — I am now ſpeaking of the call of common Providence to common Duties: I mean, ſuch Duties as God by his Word hath annexed to ſuch Providences, <hi>James</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray? is any merry? let him ſing pſalms.</hi> Do the duty of thy preſent condition: keep time with God, becauſe he keeps time with thee: he gives thee thy daily bread; then perform thy daily duty towards him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſult thy conſcience: 'Tis a proper Judg of what thou haſt done, and what thou ſhouldſt do at this inſtant. <hi>Joſeph</hi> found it ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.8, 9, Conſcience in thoſe who are enlightned, cannot eaſily ſtep over a plain duty; 'twill ſtumble at it, and demur about it, does caſt a look towards it: tho by the violence of luſt, a man may be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried another way; yet conſcience looks behind: there is a miſ-giving heart, that tells him, Thus and thus you ought to do. Hear thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeak; it may ſhew thee the right way, and turn thee into it. He is a profligate wretch indeed, who has no reverence for his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: A wiſe man's heart diſcerneth both time and judgment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.5. Conſult thy conſcience in what thou art going about; if that ſtartle, ſtop there, and conſider well with thy ſelf: don't miſtake a carnal Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a ſcruple of conſcience—Under the light of the Goſpel, conſcience is better inſtructed than to doubt of plain duties: All caſes of conſcience lie in more abſtruſe matters.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider what preſent temptation thou art under; in the light, a preſent temptation, we may ſee what is our preſent duty. The Devil ſets againſt that might and main: He cares not what we do, if he can keep us from our preſent duty: He will ſuffer us to put any thing in the room of that: you may read, pray and meditate; the Devil will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of any thing but what we ſhould do. He knows 'tis in vain to tempt ſome men to groſs ſcandalous ſins; therefore he will reach a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:42587:250" rendition="simple:additions"/> over the ſhoulder to them, to juſtle out the preſent duty that lies before them. Take this for a Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis always our duty to act in oppoſition to any preſent temptation; <hi>If ſinners entire thee, conſent thou not, Prov.</hi> 1.10. We do never more effectually reſiſt any preſent evil, than by ſetting about that good thing that is contrary to it. When the Devil ſees his temptations have this contrary effect, to awaken our zeal for God, and to ſtir us up to a more vigorous proſecution of our duty; 'tis not his intereſt to go on in that temptation which he ſees is ſuch a provocation to holineſs, and ſpurs us on the faſter to our duty. The Devil knows not this before-hand: His temptations are but tryals and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments that he makes, to ſee how we ſtand affected, and how they will take.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſult with the Word of God, eſpecially thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak to the ſtate and condition thou art in in the world; whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Servant, Parent, Child, Rich or Poor; gather up thoſe Texts, and be often reading them over to thy Faith; Mingle them afreſh every day with Faith; carry them about you in your Memory, or in a Book fair written, that you may often have your eye upon them; they will be a <hi>light to your feet, and a lanthorn to your paths:</hi> You can never walk exactly in your place and ſphere, if you do not walk by this rule, often coming to the light, that you may ſee whether your works are wrought in God. Some Chriſtians do many things, many good things in the dark; or at leaſt, by a general Scripture-light. Some confuſed Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have, but no clear diſtinct underſtanding of their duty. In converſion there are general principles laid in, inclining us to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties, which for want of ſearching the Scriptures, we take up by gueſs: but a diſtinct particular knowledg of theſe duties, is an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, diſtinct from our firſt converſion: 'tis called <hi>Edification,</hi> or <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> which makes us expert skilful Chriſtians. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make the man of God perfect, throughly furniſhed unto every good word and work,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Object. <hi>Tho by theſe directions given, I may diſcern duty from down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſin; yet I am at a loſs, how to diſtinguiſh between duty and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; between duty in ſeaſon, and duty out of ſeaſon.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> — If this be the doubt, conſider whether the Scripture hath not decided it; in ſome caſes it hath, and upon ſuch grounds as may help us in other caſes, to know our preſent duty; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly,</hi> &amp;c. When the duty poſtponed by you, does hinder the right performance of that other duty which thou art going about, and render it unacceptable to God, then the ſecond duty, as you have ranked them, muſt take place of the firſt, and be firſt done. Acts of worſhip cannot be done in Faith towards God, where Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards our Neighbour is wanting. He doth not believe in God, who loves not his brother, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.10, 23. And ſo in the other caſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, 'tis groſs hypocriſie to reprove another, when thou thy ſelf art guilty in the ſame, or a higher kind: Thou hypocrite, <hi>firſt caſt out the beam,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Object.—<hi>But what if after all this, it ſhould ſo fall out, that two duties ſhould preſs upon my conſcience for preſent performance, and I cannot, either by Reaſon or Scripture, determine which to do firſt, but do hang in ſuſpence, am in a ſtrait between two?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi>—This is hardly to be ſuppoſed; but admit it to be thy caſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy preſent judgment—Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sit down once more, and conſider, weigh them both well, and hold the ballance with a ſteddy hand: I am perſwaded you may perceive ſome preponderancy on one ſide, that may direct you what to do, from ſome over-bearing circumſtances that turn the ſcales. God is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion: He does never command two inconſiſtent duties at the ſame time: The Covenant is ordered in all things, and ſo muſt our Converſations be too; elſe we walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly: Therefore conſider well, what pleaſes God moſt, and for once leave out the relation to the preſent time, which thou art ſo much puzled about, and conſider the nature of the duties themſelves, which of them is moſt ſpiritual, which of them the Scripture lays moſt weight upon; for there is a difference between duty and duty, all are not alike; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.16, 17. <hi>a broken and a contrite heart,</hi> is beyond all other Sacrifices. God did require them too, but not without this; both together do beſt; but of the two, he had rather have this alone, than the other alone without this. Outward Offerings are never pleaſing to God, when the heart goes not along with them. Be ſure to mind that moſt, which God is moſt pleaſed with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If of two duties you cannot reſolve which is moſt your duty at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then reſolve upon both, and begin where you will; God will not be extreme in that caſe; do one, and leave not the other undone, but be ſure to find time for that alſo. When one duty doth quite take us off from the performance of another neceſſary duty that ſtood in competition with it, 'tis greatly to be ſuſpected that there is a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then; but if you do both, one after another, you can err only in point of time and order, and God will over-look that in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, who acts according to his preſent light, and would do that which God likes beſt, if he could underſtand his mind; but being not able to judg of that, he reſolves upon both ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beg of God to reſolve thee: <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes,</hi> Pſal. 119.5. Shall I go up to <hi>Hebron,</hi> or ſhall I not? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1.

                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:42587:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. All the ſins of your lives break in upon you, through the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your preſent duty. Do but ſtop that gap, and keep it ſtopt, and then there will be no room for ſin. I ſpeak not of thoſe unavoidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities that cleave to the Saints under their moſt conſcionable walking with God; but of wilful neglects that lie heavy upon the conſcience, when God awakens it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever you do in the room of a preſent duty, is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. Not acceptable, did I ſay? that is too ſoft a word; 'tis an offence to him; 'tis diſobedience, and rebellion: tho it be a duty, yet becauſe it is not that duty that God now requires, you ſin in doing it: Not that I would have Chriſtians live always diſtracting in fear, leſt what they do, ſhould not be their preſent duty: My meaning is, when we neglect a known duty, which we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of: but if we uſe means to know our duty, and do act according to our preſent light in what we do, we may have peace, and hope for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you don't now perform your preſent duty, you can never perform it, unleſs you could recall time, and make that preſent again which is paſt: Time paſſes away, and repreſents a Man to God as he was at that inſtant: what he is the next, is another thing; but that hour, that day, week, or year, which thou haſt ſpent in the neglect of thy duty, ſtands upon record againſt thee, is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable: you muſt account for that; and without a pardon, you cannot eſcape the judgment of God. Miſ-ſpent time is the treaſury of Gods wrath; and what a fiery day of wrath will that make at laſt, when God ſhall put all together, and ſum up the ſins of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of thy life, and reckon with thee for all at once, in the great day of his wrath; ſo much for ſuch an idle hour, and ſo much for ſuch an idle hour; ſo much for ſuch and ſuch a day ſpent in an <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, Tavern,</hi> or <hi>Brothel-houſe;</hi> ſo much for ſuch a year and ſuch a year, it may be for many years ſpent in open profaneſs, and all manner of debauchery. As you fill up your time with ſin, God fills it up with ſecret wrath, which will be revealed one day. Time carries along with it all the things, good or evil, that are done in that time, the neglect of a preſent duty. Leave that time void of the duty that belongs to it, and there is no going back to fill it up: As for inſtance, If your Preſent duty be Prayer, if you don't pray <hi>now,</hi> you can never pray <hi>now:</hi> You may pray afterwards, but that does not anſwer to the preſent <hi>now:</hi> You may do the ſame duty for ſubſtance at another time, but it does not bear the ſame date: That hour in which thou doſt omit any duty proper to it, will witneſs againſt thee; when that part of thy life comes under examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have a care that time does not carry an evil report of you to God. There is a voice in time, <hi>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledg,</hi> Pſal. 19.2. Time paſt is preſent with God: he ſees how it ſlips thorow thy fingers, how it is ſtained by thy ſins. Time is ill beſtowed upon thee; it may provoke God to ſhorten thy days, and to cut thee off in the midſt of thy years, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.23.</p>

                  <pb n="584" facs="tcp:42587:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>4. You can have no tryal of your ſpirit, nor of the truth of your ſtate: 'Tis impoſſible you ſhould ever prove your ſincerity, but by a conſcientious diſcharge of your preſent duty. The power of godlineſs lies much in this, in having a reſpect to God in all our common actions. There can be no Religion without this; and in this there is peace, true hearts eaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.45. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>in ipſâ latitudine.</hi> When a man ſo walks, that his conſcience meets with nothing that offends it, that ſtrikes againſt it, the way is broad enough, a plain path of duty, which is very ſatisfactory to conſcience: But when the buſineſs is dark and doubtful, looks as much like ſin as duty, a man cannot be at eaſe in this caſe; the way is very narrow, there is a grating upon the conſcience; and after all the tricks, ſalves and diſtinctions that may be uſed to juſtifie what we do, we cannot have inward peace, whilſt ſomething always rubs againſt the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as we go.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You cannot walk evenly with God, if you do not your preſent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. One would wonder to ſee what broken forms of godlineſs ſome men reſt in: They pick and chuſe here a duty, and there another: this they will do, and this they will not do: Their Religion is but a voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, what they pleaſe, pure will-worſhip. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. They will ſtint themſelves, and ſtint God; ſo much he ſhall have, and no more: They draw up to themſelves a ſcheme of Religion, ſuch as they think will ſerve the turn, and on they go in this round of duties: Here they are now, and here you ſhall find them Seven years hence. I am not againſt a method of Practical godlineſs, provided it be comprehenſive enough; but 'tis very dangerous tying up our ſelves to theſe narrow ſet forms of practical holineſs, which ſome men place all their Religion in: a ſtep far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will not go. Alas! the Providence of God may lead you to ſuch duties which you thought not of, in doing or ſuffering for him, <hi>John</hi> 21.18. Therefore you ſhould be in a readineſs to comply with every call of God, ſtanding compleat in his whole will. Preſent obedience gives underſtanding for the future; <hi>A good underſtanding have all they that do his commandments,</hi> Pſal. 111.10. Let it be the purpoſe of your heart to walk before God unto all well-pleaſing, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. and then your hearts will not reproach you while you live, <hi>Job</hi> 27.6.</p>
               <p>Some men walk very unevenly: there are ſo many gaps in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they move from duty to duty, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> quite leaping over ſome, and lightly touching upon others, as if they had no great mind to any: They act Grace ſo abruptly, that it gives no continued ſenſe; we know not where to find them: There are ſo many vacant ſpaces, ſo many blanks of omiſſion, ſo many blots and blurs of commiſſion; they drop a duty here, and another half a Mile off, that you cannot ſay, <hi>A man of God went this way.</hi> This is not even walking; their way is crooked, in and out; ſometimes they wander on the right hand, and ſometimes on the left; they never touch upon the right path, unleſs it be in croſſing the way from one ſin to another, which is rather to break thorow a duty, than to perform it. Here is no beaten path of holineſs, no continued tract of godlineſs: They don't always exerciſe themſelves to keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:42587:252" rendition="simple:additions"/> They who are not frequent in duty, are never exact in duty; their hearts cool ſo much between duty and duty, that there is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit left; they are key-cold; now and then they take up a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> read a little, dipping at a venture, but are no way concern'd in what they read; they heed it not: now and then they hear a Sermon, now and then pray, but without any life and ſpirit. They who pray but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, never pray well. <hi>Actus perficit habitum;</hi> Frequent acts beget a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and frequent acts maintain it. We can never perfect holineſs, but by a conſtaut tenor in holineſs, going on from day to day in the practiſe of it. Some trees, tho they bring not forth much fruit; yet that as is, is the bigger and fairer; but 'tis not ſo in a Chriſtian: The leſs you are in duty, the more lank and lean are your duties. As all Graces grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the heart, in an apt diſpoſition to actual exerciſe, when occaſion is given to draw them forth: And as no grace in the heart grows up alone; ſo no duty thrives in the life alone; one duty borrows ſtrength from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is bounded within another: as ſtones in a wall do bare up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo a Chriſtian is built up of many living ſtones, many graces, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties. There is the ſame reaſon to do thy duty in one thing, as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the ſame authority commands both: Unleſs you have reſpect unto all the Commandments, you truly reſpect none.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You muſt begin ſomewhere, at ſome preſent duty: Why not at this? It will be as difficult, nay, more difficult to come to Chriſt to morrow, than 'tis to day; <hi>Therefore to day hearken to his voice, and harden not your heart.</hi> Break the Ice now, and by Faith venture upon thy preſent duty wherever it lies: Do what you are now called to: You'l never know how eaſie the Yoke of Chriſt is, till 'tis bound about your necks; nor how light his Burthen is, till you have taken it up. While you judg of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at a diſtance, as a thing without you, and contrary to you, you'l never like it. Come a little nearer to it: do but take it in, actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it, and you'l find Religion carries Meat in its mouth: 'tis of a reviving, nouriſhing, ſtrengthning nature: it brings that along with it, that enables the ſoul chearfully to go thorow with it. Enter in at the ſtrait gate: You cannot judg of the way on this ſide the gate: Moſt men ſtick at the ſtrait gate. Beg of God to draw thee thorow, to lift thee over the Threſhold, and ſet thee in the narrow way; as narrow as it is, yet none who enter in at the ſtrait gate, by a true and thorow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, did ever periſh in the way: God will lead thee and ſuſtain thee, and carry thee on to the end of thy Race: <hi>Therefore be ſtrong, and ſhew thy ſelf a man, and keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his ſtatutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his teſtimonies, as it is written in the law of Moſes, that thou mayſt proſper in all that thou doſt, and whitherſoever thou turneſt thy ſelf,</hi> 1 Kings 2.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>How the well diſcharge of our preſent duty, may encourage us to hope in God for his help and aſſiſtance in all future duties.</hi>

The cauſe of deſertion is from our ſelves: God ſhews mercy for his own ſake, without any reſpect to any thing in us: But all acts of judgment and wrath take their riſe from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our ſelves that provokes God to ſuch ſeverities. Therefore let us keep cloſe to our preſent duty, and truſt God, who has promiſed never to leave us, nor forſake us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. <hi>vide Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>vide Pſal.</hi> 84.11. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10.

               <p n="3">3. A conſcientious diſcharge of our preſent duty, fits and diſpoſes our minds to the next duty.

You have nothing now to object; therefore conclude with <hi>David,</hi> That <hi>goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow thee all the days of thy life,</hi> Pſal. 23.6. <hi>He that hath delivered, will deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that the doing a preſent duty, does merit aſſiſtance for the future; but God for our encouragement in well-doing, hath graciouſly promiſed it. This is a great motive to quicken us to our preſent duty.</p>
               <p>O that every one of you would go home from this Sermon, and ſet upon your preſent duty. You that are Maſters of Families, take up <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s reſolution, and ſay every one of you in the preſence of God this day, That <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Fly all appearance of evil; declare againſt every thing that looks like ſin; let there be no lying, ſwearing, drunkenneſs, or any ſort of profaneneſs countenanced by you. Be zealous reprovers in your own gates, and walk within your houſes with a perfect heart; live in a continual fear of offending God; beg of him upon your knees, to put you into ſuch a daily exerciſe of grace, as may be moſt ſuitable to your preſent circumſtances. Grace will help you at every turn: If you thrive in your calling, grace will teach you to give God the praiſe, and to be thankful; if you ſink and go backwards, grace will teach you quietly to ſubmit, how to bear with chearfulneſs all diſappointments and loſſes
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:42587:254" rendition="simple:additions"/> you meet with; how to receive evil as well as good from God. Truly a man without grace, is a burthen to himſelf, and to every body elſe; he knows not how to receive good or evil, is in danger to be undone by one as well as the other: The proſperity of the wicked ſlays them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. their Table becomes a ſnare to them; and that which ſhould have been for their welfare, a trap, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. They will run themſelves a ground, one way or other, and come to nothing at laſt: God will turn their way upſide down, and bring confuſion upon them: <hi>But verily there is a reward for the righteous.</hi> —What I am preſſing you to, is your preſent duty; what is paſt, cannot be recalled: Your preſent duty is to repent of paſt ſins, and to walk with God in your Callings for the time to come. Be upright in your way; admit nothing into your particular Callings, that is inconſiſtent with the Principles of your general Calling, as you are Chriſtians: So carry your ſelves every one of you, that all that deal with you, may know you are a real Chriſtian. Were there a greater ſavour of grace, and of the power of godlineſs in your Shops, did you buy and ſell in the fear of God, doing all things in Faith, as to the Lord, as in his ſight, converſing with others in the fear of God, what a comely ſight would this be! what a Sermon would this be! you would be living Epiſtles of that, ſeen and read of all men; and ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Notes gathered out of the Lives of Profeſſors, may make deeper impreſſions than thoſe that are gathered out of the mouths of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Godlineſs exemplified in practiſe, ſhews it ſelf more clearly in the thing, than 'tis poſſible for us to do in words. Words convey Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things to our ears; but a holy life holds forth the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our eyes. Nothing is ſo like a man as himſelf. Godlineſs in practiſe, is godlineſs it ſelf, extant in the thing, in its own ſubſtance and nature, 'tis viſible grace, 'tis the very matter and ſubject of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſtanding forth in the Lives of Profeſſors. I wiſh we had more of this Divinity walking about our Streets, more of theſe living Epiſtles ſeen and read of all men. Theſe are the Books that will convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, and provoke them to real holineſs. You hear good Sermons, and read good Books; but Doctrines without Examples edifie little. You don't ſee and read <hi>that</hi> in the men of this Generation, that agrees with Goſpel-principles. The truth is, Saints are not ſo viſible, ſo legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as they ſhould be. We can hardly ſpell out any thing that ſavours of true Chriſtianity. 'Twould poſe a diſcerning Chriſtian, to pick out Grace out of the Lives of ſome Profeſſors: 'Tis couched under ſuch ſinful mixtures, is in ſuch a worldly dreſs, that it does not look like it ſelf. Hence it is, that many real Saints go for Hypocrites in this World, are ſuſpected by good men, and hated by bad men upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Let your light ſhine out more; away with the Buſhel that keeps in the light; and take the Lanthorn of Prudence, that only keeps out the wind. Chriſtian prudence will direct us in the right performance of our duty; but true Chriſtian prudence never takes us quite off from our preſent duty; that is Helliſh policy, not Chriſtian prudence, that diſtinguiſhes a man quite out of his duty, and pretends to give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:42587:254" rendition="simple:additions"/> Reaſon for it too. But God will catch that man in his own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and turn his wiſdom into fooliſhneſs. There can be no Reaſon given againſt a preſent duty; if it be duty, and thy duty now, Reaſon cannot countermand it: You may go to Hell with all your Reaſons, in a wilful neglect of it. But if God incline your hearts every day to make conſcience of your preſent duty, you will be always found in a holy frame, and the bleſſing of God will be upon you: you will flouriſh like the <hi>Palm</hi>-Tree, and grow like a <hi>Cedar</hi> in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> bringing forth fruit in old age: you will always be fat and flouriſhing, to ſhew the Lord is upright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>What diſtance ought we to keep in following the ſtrange faſhions of Apparel which come up in the days wherein we live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the preſent Generation is lamentably intoxicated with Novelties, and as ſadly degenerated from the gravity of ſome former Ages, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be denied, nor conceal'd, nor defended, nor, I fear, reformed.

And this has made this Queſtion (tho <hi>in retentis</hi>) to be of great importance. To which yet, before I can give a direct and diſtinct Anſwer, I muſt crave your patience, that I may lay down theſe <hi>Preliminaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. That it is exceeding difficult to fix and determine upon the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the loweſt degree of Conformity to theſe new faſhions, <hi>which is ſinful;</hi> and the <hi>maximum quod non,</hi> the higheſt degree of Conformity to them, which is <hi>not ſinful;</hi> and that becauſe the deciſion of the Point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on many nice Circumſtances, which muſt all be duly weighed; and if the Scales be not exact, and true, the hand that holds them, ſteddy; the eye that judges, clear; it will be impoſſible to form a judgment in the caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. That therefore <hi>Satan has herein the greater advantage to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach us,</hi> our own hearts to betray and deceive us, Becauſe 'tis eaſie to ſlide inſenſibly from the <hi>lawful to the unlawful,</hi> when 'tis ſo hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to a hairs-breadth, where the <hi>one ends, and the other begins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. That <hi>Pride will be ſure to perplex and entangle the controverſie.</hi> For ſeeing a haughty heart will never confine its licentiouſneſs to the narrow Rule of God, it muſt widen the Rule, and ſtretch it to its own Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies. That Luſt which ſcorns to bow its <hi>crooked practiſes</hi> to the <hi>ſtraight rule,</hi> will not fail to bend the rule (if poſſible) to its own <hi>crooked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes:</hi> For it's very uneaſie to ſit in the Stooks of a man's own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. That there may be <hi>ſome danger, as well as much difficulty in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,</hi> ſince the Univerſality of the Corruption, like a deluge, has overſpread the face of the Earth, and Intereſt is taken into the Confederacy, with whom to combate, is an unequal contention. Pride and profit, glory and gain, have their diſtinct concernments in this controverſie. And to decry the <hi>ſilver ſhrines of Diana,</hi> by which ſo many <hi>Crafts-men get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> muſt raiſe a heavy outcry againſt the Opponent: And when obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtom ſhall ſecond and back theſe corruptions, he muſt have <hi>Robur &amp; aes triplex circa pectus,</hi> a very hardy ſpirit, that ſhall dare to croſs the ſtream, or ſtem the current of a prevailing luxuriancy.

            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. That yet <hi>Charity</hi> will lend us one ſafe Rule, <hi>That we impoſe a ſeverer law upon our ſelves, and allow a larger indulgence to others.</hi> The Rule of our own converſation, ſhould be with the <hi>ſtricteſt;</hi> but that by which we cenſure others, a little more with the largeſt.

For ſeeing the beſt that can be ſaid of, and pleaded for many of our Faſhions, is, That <hi>in themſelves</hi> they are <hi>Adiaphorous,</hi> which yet <hi>in their common uſe are ſinful;</hi> it becomes a Chriſtian to be cautious, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe only that which is confeſſedly innocent and inoffenſive: For <hi>he that will always do what may lawfully be done, ſhall ſometimes do what is unlawful to be done.</hi>

            <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>An humble heart, crucify'd to the World, and making a conſcience of its baptiſmal Covenant, whereby it ſtands engaged to renounce the pomps and vanities of a wicked World, with all fomentations of, and incitations to the fleſh, will be the beſt Caſuiſt.</hi> Mortification would cut up the controverſie by the roots, cure the diſeaſe in the cauſe, and cleanſe the ſtream in the fountain.

            <p n="8">§. 8. That yet <hi>there are ſome modes of Apparel, which ſo notoriouſly croſs the ends of all Apparel, ſo inconſiſtent with the Rule of Decency, ſo apparently tranſgreſſing the bounds of Modeſty, that no pretence of an honeſt intention, no uprightneſs of heart can atone, or excuſe the evil of wearing them.</hi> As if (for inſtance) a Garment was made of Silk, wrought in ſuch Figures as did imitate <hi>the Pictures of Aratine,</hi> and repreſent <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> in all the moſt <hi>obſcene and filthy poſtures,</hi> the <hi>uſe</hi> of ſuch Raiment would be a groſs <hi>abuſe;</hi> nor could any <hi>internal chaſtity</hi> alleviate the guilt of the <hi>outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Tho ſome modes of Apparel can never be</hi> well uſed, <hi>there are none but may be ill uſed:</hi> None <hi>ſo good,</hi> but they may become <hi>bad;</hi> tho ſome ſo <hi>bad,</hi> that they never can be made <hi>good.</hi> And the reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is, becauſe <hi>Bonum oritur ex integris, malum è quolibet defectu.</hi> All Circumſtances muſt concur to render a practiſe <hi>lawful,</hi> when the want of any one (which ought to be preſent) is enough to render it ſinful.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10.

            <p n="1">(1). Let us then enquire, <hi>for what ends God appoints, and Nature requires Apparel.</hi> In the ſtate of <hi>Innocency, and Primitive Integrity,</hi> Nakedneſs was mans richeſt cloathing: <hi>No Ornament, no Raiment,</hi> was ever ſince ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as then was <hi>no-Ornament, no-Raiment:</hi> For as there was then no <hi>irregular motion</hi> in the ſoul, ſo neither was there any in the body, that might die the Cheeks with a Bluſh, or cover the Face with ſhame: <hi>They were both naked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.25.</note> 
               <hi>the Man and his Wife, and were not aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they had once violated the Covenant, and broken the Law of their Creator, Shame, the Fruit and Daughter of ſin, ſeized their ſouls, and that in reſpect <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>of each other;</hi> which <hi>latter,</hi> chiefly (as I conceive) to hide, the beſt expedient their confuſed and diſtracted thoughts could pitch upon, was, <hi>to ſtitch together a few fig-leaves, to make themſelves Aprons;</hi> till God, commiſerating their wretched plight, provided better covering, more adequate to the neceſſity of Nature, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with decency; <hi>i. e. coats of skins,</hi> Gen 3.21.</p>
            <p>Wherein the Divine Wiſdom ſo admirably contriv'd it, That their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, 1. might ſerve as a ſtanding Memorial of their demerits, that they might carry about them the continual conviction of their ſin, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment: For what leſs could they infer, than that they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>die the death,</hi> when the innocent Beaſts muſt die, to preſerve and accommodate their lives? 2. That their Apparel might direct their weak Faith to <hi>the promiſed ſeed,</hi> in whom they might expect a better covering, and from a greater ſhame, that of their filthineſs in the ſight of God: In him (I ſay) whom thoſe Beaſts probably ſlain in ſacrifice, did typifie: For that any were ſlain merely on the account of food before the Flood, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, when yet the diſtinction between the clean and unclean, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſacrifice, is demonſtrable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <pb n="595" facs="tcp:42587:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Now God appoints, and Nature (frail, faded Nature) requires Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>To hide ſhame, to cover nakedneſs.</hi> That our firſt Parents, and their Poſterity, in their Exile from Paradiſe, might not become a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>covering of the eyes,</hi> and ſhame to each other. Whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whatever Apparel, or faſhions of Apparel, do either croſs, or not comply with this great deſign of God, muſt be ſinfully uſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That as any Apparel, or faſhions of Apparel, do more or leſs croſs, or not comply with this end, they are proportionably more or leſs ſinful.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Semi-Evites,</hi> aware of danger, from theſe concluſions, to their <hi>naked breaſts,</hi> will readily reply, That this will be of no great uſe to decide this controverſie, becauſe it is not clear, 1. what parts of the body 'tis God has appointed Apparel to cover: nor 2. which of them may be uncovered without ſhame, ſeeing that ſome, as <hi>the hands, the face, the feet,</hi> may be naked, without ſin to our ſelves, or offence to others. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the uſe of the parts,</hi> and their <hi>deſtinated ends,</hi> are to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this caſe. The uſe of the Face, is chiefly to diſtinguiſh, 1. <hi>the Sex,</hi> the <hi>Male</hi> from the <hi>Female;</hi> 2. the <hi>Individuals,</hi> one perſon from another: the uſe of the <hi>hands,</hi> is, that they may be inſtruments for work, buſineſs, and all manual operations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to cover, or muffle up thoſe parts ordinarily, whoſe ends and uſe requires to be uncovered, is to croſs Gods end and deſign, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſinful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That to uncover thoſe parts promiſcuouſly, and expoſe them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to open view, for which there can be no ſuch good ends and uſes aſſigned, is ſinful: For the <hi>general Law</hi> of God muſt always take place, where the <hi>ſpecial uſe</hi> of <hi>a particular part</hi> requires not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And therefore all Apparel, or faſhions of Apparel, which expoſe thoſe parts to view, of which expoſing God and Nature have aſſigned no uſe, is ſinful. 'Tis true, I confeſs, our firſt Parents in that haſty proviſion which they made againſt their ſhame, took care only for <hi>Aprons:</hi> but God, who had adequate conceptions of their wants, and what was neceſſary to ſupply them; of the Rule of Decency, and what would fully anſwer it, provided for them <hi>coats,</hi> that ſo the <hi>whole body</hi> (except as before excepted) might be cover'd, and its ſhame concealed.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Another end of Apparel was <hi>to defend the body,</hi> 1. from the <hi>ordinary injuries</hi> of unſeaſonable ſeaſons; 2. the <hi>common inconveniencies</hi> of labour and travel; 3. the <hi>emergent accidents</hi> that might befall them in their Pilgrimage. For the Fall of Man had introduced exceſſive heats and colds: They were driven out of Paradiſe, to wander and work in a Wilderneſs, now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with <hi>briars, thorns and thiſtles,</hi> the early Fruits of the late Curſe;
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:42587:258" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Cloaths were aſſigned them in this exegency for a kind of <hi>defenſive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> Hence we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.38. That <hi>Saul</hi> armed <hi>David</hi> with <hi>his own armour, and he arm'd him with a coat of mail.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>Saul</hi> cloath'd <hi>David with his cloaths, and he cloath'd him with a coat of mail.</hi> And the word there uſed, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is of near cognation with that in my Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Hence therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whatever modes of Apparel comply not with this gracious end of God, in defending our bodies from thoſe inconveniences, are ſinfully worn and uſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a horrid cruelty to our frail bodies, to expoſe them to thoſe injuries againſt which God has provided a remedy, to gratifie pride, or to humour any Vanity. And however our Gallants hope to keep themſelves warm, and to ſhelter their ſin under the skreen of their own fooliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Pride feels no cold;</hi> yet God has oftentimes made their ſin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their puniſhment, whilſt by an obſtinate ſtriving with the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of an ill-contrived Mode, they have hazarded, if not loſt, their Healths, if not their Lives, by a ridiculous Complement to ſome new faſhion. But how they will ſtand before the righteous Judgment-Seat of God, when he ſhall arraign, and try them as Guilty of <hi>Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in the great day of ſcrutiny, they may do well timely to adviſe upon, and conſider.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. To theſe I may add, That when God made Man his <hi>firſt ſuit of Apparel,</hi> he <hi>took meaſure of him</hi> by that Employment which he had cut out for him. Man's aſſigned work was labour; not to eat the bread of idleneſs, but firſt to earn it in the ſweat of his face; which tho at firſt it was a Curſe, is by Grace converted into a Bleſſing. And accordingly God ſo adapted, and accommodated his cloaths to his body, that they might not hinder readineſs, expedition, induſtry, diligence, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the works of his particular Calling. Hence theſe things will be exceeding plain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God having appointed Man to labour, cannot be ſuppoſed to have made any proviſion for, or given the leaſt indulgence to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Intervals for reſt, to redintegrate the decay'd Spirits; ceſſation for a ſeaſon from hard labour, God allows, and Nature requires; but exemption from a particular Calling, or any diſpenſation for ſloth in that Calling, we find none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God having ſuited cloathing in all its forms and ſhapes, ſo to the body, that they prejudice him not in the works of his particular Calling whatever faſhions of Apparel do incommode him therein, and render him unfit, or leſs fit to diſcharge the duties of it, are ſo far ſinfully uſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That therefore they who by unmerciful lacing, girding, bracing, pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in uneaſie garments, can ſcarce breathe, leſs eat, and leaſt of all labour, do apparently offend againſt this end of God; and it is but juſt, that they who will not, or create an impotency that they cannot work, ſhould not eat, nor long breathe in the earth, whereof they are unprofitable burdens.</p>

However they cannot juſtly complain of Providence, who gave them their option, and left them to their own deſires, <hi>Rather to be out of the world, than out of the faſhion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. There is yet another end of Apparel, <hi>viz. The adorning of the body.</hi> And in this all our wanton Faſhioniſts take ſanctuary. Out of which, that I may <hi>force them,</hi> or (ſo far as is ſober and moderate) <hi>indulge them,</hi> I ſhall firſt premiſe a few <hi>Obſervations,</hi> and then lay down ſome <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1). Let theſe few things be premiſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Ornamentals,</hi> ſtrictly taken as diſtinct from <hi>uſeful garments,</hi> do not come under the ſame appointment of God, with <hi>neceſſary cloathing.</hi> For, 1. It is ordinarily ſinful to wear <hi>no Apparel;</hi> but not ſo, to wear <hi>no ſuch Ornaments.</hi> 2. The neceſſity of Nature requires the one, but no neceſſity or end of Nature requires the other. Gods ends, and Natures occaſions may be ſecured, and anſwered to the full, without theſe additionals: Ornaments then are rather matter of-<hi>indulgence,</hi> than <hi>precept;</hi> of <hi>permiſſion,</hi> than <hi>injunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That plain ſimple Apparel, as it is a real, ſo 'tis a ſufficient Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body: For if Nakedneſs be our ſhame, Apparel that hides it, is ſo far its beautifying and adorning. When therefore we ſay, God gave cloaths for an Ornament, we do not ſay, that he gave ornaments diſtinct from cloathing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Ornaments are either <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Artificial: Natural,</hi> ſuch as Nature has provided, as <hi>the hair,</hi> given by God and Nature to <hi>the woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to be her glory, and for her covering: Artificial,</hi> ſuch as are the product of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and witty invention. In which, as God has been <hi>not illiberal,</hi> ſo Man
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:42587:259" rendition="simple:additions"/> has been <hi>very prodigal;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.29.</note> and not content with <hi>primitive ſimplicity, has found out many inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is evident, that God allowed the <hi>Jews</hi> the uſe of <hi>Artificial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi> as diſtinct from neceſſary Apparel: <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.2. <hi>Aaron ſaid to the people, Bring us of the golden ear-rings that are in the ears of your wives, your ſons, and your daughters.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>And when</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaw that the people were naked, for Aaron had made them naked to their ſhame, amongſt their enemies; That Moſes ſtood, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems then, that to be <hi>ſtript of their ear-rings,</hi> was in ſome ſenſe to be <hi>made naked,</hi> to <hi>be expoſed to ſhame</hi> in <hi>the ſight of their enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That yet there was <hi>ſome difference</hi> between the <hi>Indulgence granted to the male,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Piſgah ſight.</note> 
               <hi>and that to the female ſex:</hi> And this Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> obſerves from the order and placing of the words <hi>Wives, Sons, Daughters;</hi> intimating, that thoſe <hi>Sons</hi> were <hi>in their minority</hi> (under <hi>Covert-parent,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it); and ſo much ſeems to be implyed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10. where we find indeed the <hi>Bridegrooms Ornaments,</hi> but onely <hi>the Brides Jewels:</hi> as if the Maſculine Sex was reſtrained to a more <hi>Manly and grave ſort of Ornaments:</hi> when as the <hi>Female</hi> was allowed a greater degree of finery and gallantry.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="6">6 That tho there might be ſomething Typical or Symbolical in the Jewels wore by the Jewiſh Women, (as I conceive there was) that yet the uſe of them was of common right to the Females of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as indeed they were of ordinary uſe long before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was ſetled: <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.23. <hi>The man took an ear-ring of gold, of half a ſhekel,</hi> (a quarter of an ounce) <hi>and two bracelets for her hands</hi> (Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's) <hi>of ten ſhekels</hi> (five ounces.)</p>

               <hi>While they behold your chaſte converſation coupled with fear; whoſe adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price:</hi> Whence theſe things offer themſelves to your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. 1. That <hi>plaiting the hair, wearing of gold,</hi> or golden Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are not <hi>ſimply, and in themſelves condemned;</hi> but onely ſo far, as they are either our <hi>Chiefeſt Ornament;</hi> or as we are too <hi>Curious,</hi> too <hi>Coſtly, Exceſſive,</hi> or <hi>Expenſive</hi> in them: for otherwiſe, <hi>the putting on of Apparel,</hi> which is joyn'd in the ſame thred and texture of the Diſcourſe and Sentence, would be condemned alſo. 2. That the rule for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating theſe Ornamentals, is, <hi>That they be viſibly conſiſtent with a chaſte converſation:</hi> I ſay, <hi>viſibly conſiſtent:</hi> It muſt be ſuch a chaſte Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may be <hi>beheld, whilſt they behold your chaſte converſation.</hi> That pure <hi>veſtal fire of Chaſtity</hi> that burns upon the Altar of a Holy Heart, muſt flame out, and ſhine in chaſtity of words, actions, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adorning; for whenever God commands <hi>chaſtity,</hi> he commands whatever may feed and nouriſh it, manifeſt and declare it; and forbids whatever may endanger it; wound, or weaken, blemiſh, or impair it. 3. That <hi>Godly fear</hi> muſt be placed as a ſevere Sentinel, to keep ſtrict guard over the Heart, that nothing be admitted that may defile our own hearts; nothing ſteal out that may polute anothers; we muſt keep watch over our own Hearts, and other mens Eyes: Neither lay a ſnare for the Chaſtity of another, nor a bait for our own. This chaſte Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation muſt be <hi>coupled with fear.</hi> 4. Which Holy Fear, and Godly Jealouſie will have work enough abour the matter of Ornament; that we neither miſtake <hi>in our Judgment,</hi> as if theſe outward Adornings with Gold, with Plaited Hair, were of ſuch grand concernment; nor were <hi>in our practiſe</hi> in an immoderate care, and ſuperfluous coſt about them. 5. To render that Rule which he hath laid down, Practicable, he gives us a pattern, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>After this manner in the old time, the holy women that truſted in God adorn'd themſelves.</hi> Where note, 1. That they muſt be <hi>holy women</hi> that are the ſtandard of our Imitation; not Painting <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> nor Dancing <hi>Dinah,</hi> nor Flaunting <hi>Bernice;</hi> but Holy <hi>Sarah,</hi> Godly <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Prudent <hi>Abigail.</hi> 2.

They muſt be ſuch as could <hi>truſt in God</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from evil, becauſe they ruſhed not themſelves into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for it's hardly conceivable how any ſhould <hi>truſt in God</hi> to give them Victory, who tempt, and challenge the Combate: or how they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

            <p n="3">3. That yet there ſeems ſome diſtinctive Ornament to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by God, that the difference between the Sexes might not be left to the Arbitrary Cuſtoms, and deſultory Humours of Men: As in <hi>the hair of the head,</hi> and the manner of wearing it; or at leaſt in the Beard, which is ordinarily given to the one Sex, and denied the other: And hence it ſeems probable, <hi>That for Women to poll, for Men to nouriſh the Hair at the full length, is a Contravention to the diſcriminating badge and cognizance which the God of Nature has beſtowed upon them.</hi>

But let it be conſidered, 1. That the Phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even Nature it ſelf, ſeems to reſtrain the word to its proper and primary ſignification. 2.

But ſuppoſing, that Cuſtom onely had formerly taught the Men to wear their hair ſhort, and Women theirs at the utmoſt length; and that encroaching-practice, in proceſs of time ſhould introduce the contrary Cuſtom, for Women to Poll, and Men to nouriſh their hair; yet how many Millions of ſins muſt be committed, ere the new Cuſtom could prevail to joſtle out the old, and legitimate the new practice? ſo that they who plead this for themſelves, do but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves at the coſt of other Mens condemnation. 4. As the caſe ſtands with us, the Cuſtom is not ſo general, either for the number, or quality of the perſons (if by quality we underſtand thoſe of a Pious and Religious character) as to juſtify the Modern deviation from a general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received practice: but this I confeſs, if the commonneſs of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom be not extenſive enough to take away <hi>the ſin,</hi> 'tis yet ſo prevailing, that it has taken away <hi>the ſenſe of it</hi> in the Conſciences of very many Profeſſors.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> Nothing ought to be allowed for Ornament, which croſſes the great end of all Apparel, covering of Nakedneſs. The <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh</hi> Women are ſaid to have been <hi>made Naked to their ſhame,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 47.2, 3.</note> which tho it be meant of <hi>a neceſſitated nakedneſs,</hi> which may be a reproach, but not a ſin; yet when that is done <hi>voluntarily,</hi> which then was done neceſſarily, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:42587:261" rendition="simple:additions"/> both the ſin and the reproach. 3. It is pleaded, That what they do is not out of Pride, to glory in the beauty of the skin; nor out of Luſt, to inveigle others to become enamoured at their beauty; but onely to avoid the reproach of a moroſe ſingularity, and a little perhaps to comply with what has the vogue among the more Gentile and well-bred perſons: To remove this: 1. It is a branch of Holy ſingularity, rather to be ſober alone, than mad for company: What Chriſtian would not rather chuſe to lag behind, than ſtrain himſelf to keep pace with a hairbrain'd Age in all its endleſs and irrational uſages? And, 2. Compliance with a vain hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourſom generation, is ſo far from being an excuſe, that 'tis an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the vanity of the practiſe: But theſe are onely the <hi>cauſae ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificae,</hi> the umbrages invented to palliate the extravagancy: the <hi>cauſae ſua ſociae,</hi> lie much deeper, which becauſe we cannot in all make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, we muſt leave them to the cenſures of their own Conſciences. I dare not ſay, 'tis to allure or invite Cuſtomers: tho what does the open Shop and Sign at the Door ſignify, but that there's ſomething Venal? Nor ſhall I tax the practiſe of Ambition, to ſhew the fineneſs, clearneſs, and beauty of the skin; tho if it were ſo, I would ask, Who are concern'd, I pray, to know what hew, what colour it is of, but either their lawful Husbands, or unlawful Paramours? In the mean time this too plain is, That Arrogance and Impudence have uſurpt the place, and produced the effect of Primitive ſimplicity; and Women are now <hi>almoſt naked,</hi> but <hi>not at all aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> What ever pretends to be an Ornament which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucres that Natural Ornament which God has beſtowed, is not an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, but a Defilement.</p>
            <p>The Harmony and Symmetry of the parts each to other, made and poſited conveniently and proportionably to their proper ends, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective uſes,<note place="margin">Theoph.</note> is the real beauty of the outward man: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon the front of this is Engraved in Capital Letters, <hi>Deus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit,</hi> God is not, we ſhould not, be <hi>aſhamed</hi> of it, much leſs ſhould we be <hi>a ſhame to it:</hi> The throne of this beauty is the countenance, which, 'tis the will of God ſhould ordinarily be uncover'd, that the Workman may be ſeen in his Wormanſhip. And yet this Frontiſpiece, this Portal of the Fabrick, which ſhews ſo much of Divine Art, God will have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, when the expoſing it to view, ſhall expoſe the Soul to temptation: God would have us turn away our own eyes from beholding Vanity; and has provided a nimble covering, that with one twinkle we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Dart ſhot at us out of the Devils Bow, by whatſoever Hand, or from whatſoever Quiver: and ſo would he have us turn away the eyes of others too, when they may wound themſelves, and ſuck Poyſon from the Flower of Lovelineſs and Beauty. Now if God would have the Face covered, whoſe great end requires the open view, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering would do harm; how much more would he have the Breaſts covered, whoſe uncovering may do harm, but can do no good, having
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:42587:261" rendition="simple:additions"/> no Lawful end or uſe aſſigned for ſuch laying open? And if God would have the Face, the ſeat of Beauty, to be viſible, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe who by Patching disfigure it, who by Painting diſcolour it, that we may now ſeek God in his Workmanſhip, and his Workmanſhip in the Face, and find neither?</p>
            <p>How had theſe Wantons repin'd at their Creation, and perhaps blaſphem'd their Creator, had he made them as they have marr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? They had no doubt got a room in the Chronicles amongſt the prodigious and monſtrous Births, had they been born with <hi>Moons, Stars, Croſſes, Lozenges</hi> upon their Cheeks, eſpecially had they brought into the World with them <hi>a Coach and Horſes.</hi> But here we ſhall be attacqued with ſome Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Is it not Lawful to conceal a groſs deformity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, no doubt; but not a Natural deformity, with an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial vanity. He that gave thee thy ordinary Cloathing, expects thou wilt uſe them to hide thy blemiſhes; but will nothing ſerve thy turn, but a fantaſtick vanity?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Lawful to hide a deformity, but not with a greater than that thou wouldſt conceal: a black Patch (forſooth) is pretended to hide a blemiſh, either natural, or it may be accidentally contracted: well, be it ſo: I demand then, what if God had branded thy Cheek, or ſtigmatiz'd thy Forehead with an Eſcar of the ſame figure and colour with that which thou haſt invented to hide what thou now haſt? Would not ſuch a mark have been accounted a greater blemiſh than what thou now complaineſt of? Why then doſt thou, vain Woman, hide a blemiſh with a deformity? All the quarrel I perceive thou haſt againſt the Natural, is, that it was of Gods making: and all the fancy thou haſt for the Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is, becauſe it was of thy own.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Much leſs is it Lawful to hide a Natural beauty, with an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial deformity: for what is this but to be aſhamed of what God has done exceeding well, and then to glory in what thou haſt made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Is it not Lawful to conciliate beauty where it is not, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it where it already is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> An humble ſubmiſſion to the Divine good pleaſure is the beſt Remedy for imaginary or real defects: Has God made any of us veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of courſer earth? <hi>Who ſhall ſay to the potter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.9.</note> 
               <hi>why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Let the potſheard ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth. The beſt covering for the defects of the Face, is to lay our hand upon our mouth, and our mouth in the duſt, and to be dumb with ſilence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Lord hath done it: wherefore then doſt thou contend with him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.9. Job 33.13.</note> 
               <hi>who gives not account of any of his matters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. True Grace is the moſt excellent Receit for beautifying your Face: <hi>wiſdom makes the face to ſhine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 8.1.</note> There is ſomething (tho hard to ſay what it is) in an unaffected gravity, an unforced modeſty, in an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:42587:262" rendition="simple:additions"/> affable deportment, free, and natural, without ſtarch, and pedantry, that recommends and endears more to the acceptation of the judicious, than all the curious mixtures of Artificial fading colours.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Perhaps the evil of thy ſuppoſed defect and ſhortneſs, is more in fancy, than in reality: thou art well enough, very well, if thou couldſt think ſo: when we conſider our Moral blemiſhes, we deceive our ſelves, that we are good, becauſe not ſo bad as the worſt; but when we reflect on our Natural defects, we are apt to repine, becauſe we are not as good as the beſt: and whilſt we pore only on what we want, we loſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and our God, the Glory of what we have.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And it ſhould be conſidered, that as ſome deſigning to make it burn the clearer, ſnuff the Candle too long, and ſo near, till they quite extinguiſh it: and as others are always Carining the veſſel of the Body with Phyſick, waſhing and tallowing with External applications, till they ſink it: ſo are many tampering continually to mend the Feature and Complexion, which God made very well, becauſe it pleaſed him to make them no other, till they utterly ſpoil them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But yet we muſt know, that there is <hi>a mid-ſiz'd Beauty, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate rate of comelineſs,</hi> which the Ancients called, <hi>formam ſtatam,</hi> ſuch a mediocrity as is <hi>below envy,</hi> and <hi>above contempt:</hi> concerning which I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this <hi>moderate aſſize of beauty</hi> is the ſafeſt poſture, and moſt ſecure from <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>receiving miſchief;</hi> from tempting, or being tempted, that we could be placed in. It is ſo in all outward concernments. The <hi>Cedar of Lebanon</hi> is expoſed to ſtorms: The <hi>Thiſtle of Lebanon</hi> liable to be trampled on, and trodden down by the inſolent foot of every wild Beaſt of the Foreſt. And when we come to caſt up our Accounts in a dying day, or to give up our Accounts in the laſt day, we ſhall find, and acknowledge it to have been ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Lawful by Natural means to recover what preternatural acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have taken away. If ſickneſs has impair'd thy complexion and beauty, health will reſtore it; let the Phyſician do his part, and reſtore health, and health will not be wanting to hers, and reſtore decay'd come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs better than the Painter. That the Phyſician is Gods Ordinance, primarily to preſerve life, and reſtore health, I know; but whoſe the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, when employ'd about the redintegrating of faded beauty, you were beſt to inquire of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> for I confeſs my ignorance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not lawful to aſpire after, nor endeavour to procure the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of beauty that is attainable by Art, when Nature has denied it in things of greater value and nobler uſe than periſhing complexon. God has ſet due bounds to our towring thoughts: I cannot conceive it lawful for me to deſire <hi>Paul</hi>'s gifts, unleſs I had his employment; and we may poſſibly overſhoot our ſelves in begging for the higheſt meaſures of ſome Graces, unleſs what God calls us to, ſhall need them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor is it lawful to endeavour to reſtore by Art what the ordinary courſe of time and age has deprived us of: It ſeems to me that we ſhould acquieſce in the devaſtations which time has made upon our Bodies,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:42587:262" rendition="simple:additions"/> otherwiſe, than as a rate of health ſuitable to that declining, may make us more lively, active, chearful and vigorous in Gods work.</p>

               <hi>The hoary head is a crown of glory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16.31. Prov. 20.29.</note> 
               <hi>And the beauty of old men is the gray head.</hi> And are we aſham'd of our Glory? Do we deſpiſe our Crown? Will nothing ſerve but juvenile hairs on an aged head; muſt we needs try concluſions to fetch back the Spring in Autumn? the former is indeed more pleaſant, the latter more fruitful and profitable; who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Harveſt for the Seed-time? Yet ſuch is our frowardneſs, youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perukes muſt (if not make) yet counterfeit black hairs, where age has made them gray; and thus not ſeeking true Glory in the way of Righteouſneſs, we affect and purſue a falſe, an imaginary honour, in a way of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice for the firſt inquiry: <hi>What are the ends for which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and Nature needs Apparel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2). Come we to the ſecond: <hi>What is the true rule of decency in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all indecent Apparel is a tranſgreſſion of a general rule, Let all things be done decently, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in a right Scheme, in a decent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, is eaſily granted: but to fix and ſettle the rule of decency,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.42.</note> will be a matter of greater difficulty: eſpecially ſince much controverſie has been raiſed about it on another and greater occaſion: what influence it may have upon our main inquiry, will appear from this confeſſed truth, That the ſuitableneſs or unſuitableneſs, and by conſequence the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of all Apparel to the perſon that wears it, will depend ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much on its agreeing or diſagreeing with this rule of decency.</p>
            <p>There are ſix things which in conjunction, as I conceive, will compleat this rule. 1. <hi>The outward condition.</hi> 2. <hi>The Age.</hi> 3. <hi>The Sex of the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> 4. <hi>The Climate.</hi> 5. <hi>The Law of the Land.</hi> 6. <hi>The Cuſtoms of the place where or under which Providence has caſt our habitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>The condition of the wearer, in outward reſpects, is of great conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:</hi> for tho all men are made of the <hi>ſame Metal and Materials</hi> by Creation, yet all are not caſt <hi>in the ſame Mold</hi> by Providence; one wears <hi>a publick, and politick,</hi> another <hi>a private Character:</hi> God has placed one on the Throne, whilſt he has ſet millions to grind at the Mill: ſome are Rich, others poor: ſome cut out for Maſters, others ſhaped for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And it ſeems to me, that there ſhould be ſome diſtinction in <hi>the outward habit,</hi> proportionable to what Providence has made in the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition:</hi> But to render this Obſervation ſerviceable to the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, take theſe Propoſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> It is lawful, and in ſome reſpects neceſſary, that Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates, eſpecially in the Solemn exerciſe of their proper and reſpective Offices, be diſtinguiſhed by their Robes from private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and from each other.</p>
            <p>All civiliz'd Nations have ſo unanimouſly concurred in this diſtinction, that we may receive it as the dictate of Nature, the Vote of Univerſal

               <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> wore his <hi>Royal Robes,</hi> tho the wearing them once had like to have coſt him dearer, than the matter and making: <hi>Solomon's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glory</hi> was the admiration of the <hi>Queen of Sheba;</hi> and yet when he ſhone in all his external Luſter and Splendor, was not array'd like <hi>the Lilly of the field,</hi>

            <p>Only here I muſt recommend to you theſe Cautions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution</hi> 1. <hi>All cuſtoms that will authoriſe and warrant your imitation,</hi> muſt be <hi>rationabiles conſuetudines, reaſonable Cuſtoms;</hi> ſuch as claſh not with, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not againſt, any Maxime of right Reaſon.</p>
            <p>It's a Maxime of Reaſon, That <hi>the particular modes of Apparel ſhould anſwer the general ends of all Apparel.</hi> No Cuſtom will juſtifie that Mode which expoſes ſhame and nakedneſs to publick view. Another Maxime of Reaſon, That <hi>what was appointed to preſerve life, ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to deſtroy it.</hi> A Maxime of Reaſon, <hi>That none ſhould glory in that which ſin and ſhame brought into the World:</hi> And therefore no Apparel ſhould make us proud, ſince all Apparel was thus introduced. If an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Cuſtom ſhall plead time out of mind, and bolſter up it ſelf with Antiquity, let it know, That <hi>nulla conſuetudo occurrit Rationi;</hi> no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, how ancient ſoever, can preſcribe againſt the Law of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution</hi> 2. <hi>All faſhions of Apparel that will</hi> juſtifie themſelves by <hi>Cuſtom, muſt be able to plead univerſality among them that in other things make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their ways and actions.</hi> The Cuſtom of <hi>a few good men,</hi> or of <hi>many wicked men,</hi> will be an unſafe Rule by which to judg of Decency. One ſpeckled Bird will not warrant us all to be <hi>Jayes and Magpyes.</hi> A ſingle <hi>Cato</hi> would abhor thoſe Garments which <hi>Varro</hi> calls <hi>Veſtes Vitreas, Glaſs-Cloaths,</hi> and which <hi>Suidas</hi> terms, <hi>Tunicas interlucentes, laticed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> wherein, under the pretence of covering, the <hi>Debauchees</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> diſcovered their Nakedneſs. Nor ſhould a thouſand precedents encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage one ſober Chriſtian to herd with thoſe in this, who in many other things give a demonſtration, That they are under no ties of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caution</hi> 3. <hi>Not only Cuſtoms which croſs the ends of Nature, and the Rules of Scripture, but ſuch as are vain, and trifling, contribute nothing to the Rule of Decency.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.36.</note> Our bleſſed Saviour has left us a ſmart word, <hi>That every idle word that a man ſhall ſpeak, he ſhall give an account thereof in the day

And if of every <hi>idle word,</hi> no doubt of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idle action and practice.</hi> If we could then certainly tell what an <hi>idle word is,</hi> we might with the ſame labour learn what an <hi>idle action</hi> is. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an <hi>idle word</hi> in that Text, denote <hi>a falſe, or blaſphemous ſpeech,</hi> I ſee not how we can make any uſe of it here: But with the leave of <hi>that learned Paraphraſt,</hi> who thus gloſſes it, I conceive an idle word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what below that, and does ſignifie whatever ſpeech is not deſigned for ſome good end and uſe, either Natural or Moral; Diſcourſe, that has no tendency to any thing that is good, or uſeful: And if ſo, what may we judg of vain Apparel, which complies not with any end of God, of Nature; which neither hides, nor warms, nor adorns the body. But thus much of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Inquiry.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) I come to the Third; <hi>From what inward Principles theſe outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of Apparel are taken up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As is the Heart, ſo is the Man; and as is the Man, ſuch commonly will the Garb, the Apparel, all his outward Behaviour and Deportment be. An evil mind will give an evil tincture to every thing he uſes:<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> 
               <hi>Unto them that are defiled, is nothing pure.</hi> Only we muſt here remember (what was before obſerved), That tho an evil Principle will make the action that proceeds from it, ſin; a good one will not ſerve to convert an indifferent action into good, if there be not a concurrence of all other circumſtances which ought to be preſent. But hence we ſhall gain one general Rule: <hi>All faſhions of Apparel, however lawful in themſelves, that ſpring from, or give indications of an evil heart, are ſinfully uſed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suet.</note> 
               <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> was wont to ſay, That <hi>Rich and gay cloathing was either the ſign of Pride, or the nurſe of Luxury.</hi> Perhaps he might be miſtaken: Nor can any ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connexion between Pride and coſtly Apparel be demonſtrated, as ſhall <hi>infallibly</hi> prove them ſinful. Nevertheleſs when at any time they do ſo ſpring from an evil Principle, they may without violating the Law of Charity, be doomed as evil. It was an Argument of the ſobriety of that great Emperor, what the ſame Author reports of him, That <hi>he never wore any Apparel but ſuch as his Wife, his Siſter, or Daughter made for him.</hi> Nor indeed do we read of any ſuch Trade as that of a <hi>Taylor,</hi> in all the Scripture; which argues the ſimplicity and plainneſs of their habits, that they needed little art and skill, little labour and pains to make them up.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Four main Principles,</hi> amongſt ſome others, from whence theſe <hi>ſtrange uncouth faſhions may,</hi> and (I fear ordinarily) do ariſe; <hi>levity of Mind, Vain-glory, Flattery, and Idleneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>Levity of Mind</hi> is certainly an evil frame (if that may be called <hi>a frame,</hi> which never abides ſo long as to form an acquired habit). This various humour has thus much of good in it, that if it chops on an evil and incommodious faſhion, it will never continue long in it. <hi>Aliquiſ<expan>

'Tis ſtrange to hear our Gallants cry up, and cry for that Mode to day, which they will decry, and throw away to morrow; and yet more ſtrange, to hear a new-born Faſhion extolled for the <hi>moſt commodious, convenient, uſeful,</hi> that ever appear'd; and yet when a newer Mode ſtarts up before them, to decry it as <hi>abſurd, ridiculous, and inconvenient;</hi> and all the <hi>Epithetes</hi> which ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday were ſtudied to adorn it, are transferred to the latter. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this</hi> (ſays the Prophet),<note place="margin">Iſa. 46.8.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Whatever modes of Apparel do indicate, or proceed from a ſpirit of vain-glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tolet. inſtr. ſac. lib. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>aut Caeſar, aut Nullus,</hi> either <hi>All, or Nothing.</hi> And the Malignity of it lies, either, 1. In hunting after applauſe for ſome Excellency that he would be thought to have in him, when he has it not: Or 2. In aſpiring after glory on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome little worth, far more than the thing deſerves: Or 3. In being ambitious of glory from that which really deſerves reproach and contempt. Hence we have theſe Rules:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 1. It argues a vitious frame of heart, to affect the appearance of being rich by coſtly Apparel, when one is really poor. 'Tis no very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable quality, to deſire to be thought rich, tho a Man be what he would be thought. We ſhould rather give the <hi>Donor</hi> his glory of them, and glorifie him with them, than make them Matter of Oſtentation. But to affect the Appearance without the Thing, is ſomewhat that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a harder Name than I ſhall give it. What a deſpicable thing was the poor <hi>Jaye</hi> in the Fable, when every <hi>Bird</hi> had re-aſſumed her own Feathers, and ſtript the ſilly Creature naked of its Fools-Coat! What folly, to be accounted rich, when thou art poor! and by that which makes thee ſo! What Vanity, to deſire the ſhadow, when thou haſt not the ſubſtance, and when the ſhadow eats out the ſubſtance! which is the caſe of too many amongſt us, who hang their whole Inheritance on their backs, and even that is not yet paid for, but muſt be ſet on the back-ſide of the <hi>Mercer</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <pb n="615" facs="tcp:42587:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 2. It argues a proud ſpirit to affect admiration and applauſe from cloathing. They that have no ſolid Excellency, commonly court the notice of the World by ſome exterior adventitious bravery. How do our Gallants expect reverence, if not adoration, for their whiſtling Silks, and ruffling Periwigs; and that all ſhould riſe, and bow to their ſtate, port, and grandeur! Thy Silks and Periwigs are but Excrements; and the latter, perhaps of one that died of the <hi>Foul Diſeaſe,</hi> or at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <hi>Tertullian</hi> nips this Humour ſeverely: <hi>Nè exuvias alieni,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 3. It argues the moſt wretched forlorn ſpirit that can be imagin'd, to hunt for applauſe from ſuch faſhions as are a ſhame to thy Profeſſion, to thy Perſon, Family, Age, Sex, and Species. If it be ſinful to affect glory from <hi>beauty,</hi> what is it then to affect it from a borrowed, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit beauty? If from thy <hi>own</hi> curled, criſped <hi>hair,</hi> what then from <hi>falſe hair?</hi> If from ſo mean a thing as thy own <hi>red and white,</hi> what then from painting, patching, and an adulterate Complexion?<note place="margin">Tertul. de cult.

They grievouſly offend God, that dawb their skin with oyntments, and Slibber-ſauces, that be-ſmear their cheeks with Vermilion, that black their eye-brows with Stibium: It ſeems they are aſhamed</hi> (forſooth) <hi>of Gods handy-work.

               <hi>ergo quod fingitur Diaboli negotium eſt. That which is natural, is Gods own work; and therefore that which is counterfeit and artificial, is the invention of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. That Apparel that proceeds from, or indicates a fawning adulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirit, is worn with the ſin of the wearer. This was <hi>Judah</hi>'s ſin, in her ſtrange Exotick Attire, ſervilely crouching, and accommodating her ſelf to their potent Neighbours Faſhions, that they might inſinuate, and ſcrew themſelves into their favour and affections. Nothing paſs't for gentile, and gallant, but what was <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> after the Mode of <hi>Babylon:</hi> which ſeems to be the collogueing humour of <hi>Frenchified Engliſh;</hi> whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs it is to lie watching for the firſt <hi>Poſt</hi> that may bring them the bleſſed News, in what Dreſs the Queen, and Court appeared in the laſt Mask, Ball, or Play at the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Miſchiefs have always fatally attended this frenzy: one, That we ſeldom imitate the Modes of Apparel of another Nation, but we learn their Immoralities, and commonly their Idolatries. A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, That the Divine Juſtice commonly plagues a People by that Nation they moſt dote on. A Third is, That it's very ſeldom that any Nation is fond of the Vanities of another, but they barter away Realities to purchaſe thoſe Vanities. For when Luſt is Clerk of the
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:42587:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> Market, all ſhall go, rather than forego the dearly beloved Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Whatever Faſhions, or Modes of Apparel, are the reſult of <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> are juſtly condemned as ſinful. There are a ſort of <hi>male feriata in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia;</hi> brains, whoſe employment it is to do nothing, with a world of ſtudy; who do <hi>Magno c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">(4.) Proceed we now to the laſt Inquiry: <hi>What are the conſequences or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which theſe Modes and ſtrange Faſhions of Apparel have upon our ſelves or others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Chriſtian is bound to conſider his ways, whither they tend, and in what they are like to iſſue; not only that his ends and aims be right, but that his actions be ſuch as may reach them. There is, 1. <hi>The end of the work: Finis operis:</hi> And 2. <hi>The end of the workman: Finis operantis.</hi> The end of the work is either, 1. ſuch as follows <hi>neceſſarily, or naturally</hi> from it; <hi>Finis per ſe:</hi> Or 2. that which <hi>accidentally, or contingently</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thereupon; <hi>Finis per accidens.</hi> Thus far then we may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p n="1">§. 1. For ſober perſons to imitate the Faſhions of the looſe, ſo as to take away all external diſtinction between the vertuous and debaucht, is culpable.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.2.</note> The Apoſtle would have <hi>chaſtity viſible in the converſation,</hi> and particularly in the Apparel; which is one thing that fills up our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God would not have the World huddled up in a Miſt; that all outward difference between the precious and the vile, ſhould be taken away.<note place="margin">De cult. Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> is very earneſt with ſober women, that in their <hi>viſiting the ſick, going to the publick worſhip, in all their civil viſits and congreſſes, they ſhould apparel themſelves ſo, ut fit inter Ancillas Dei, &amp; Diaboli diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimen;</hi> that there be a viſible diſcrimination between the Servants of God, and the Handmaids of the Devil. 'Tis pity there are any ſuch proffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wretches: but ſeeing there are, and will be ſo, it's a thouſand pities but they ſhould be known by their Attire. It was ſo of old: We read of a young man,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.10.</note> met by a woman in <hi>the Attire of an Harlot;</hi> and ſhe was no Hypocrite, her Heart was as Whoriſh as her Habit. <hi>Judah</hi> took <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> upon ſuſpicion for one of the ſame character,<note place="margin">Gen. 38.14.</note> partly by <hi>her veil,</hi> but more by her <hi>ſitting in an open place by the high-way-ſide.</hi> But we may now take up a lamentation, As is the <hi>profane,</hi> ſo is the <hi>profeſſor;</hi> and as is
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:42587:268" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Harlot,</hi> ſo in this particular are many whom we hope to be <hi>chaſte.</hi> If a <hi>wiſe man</hi> would not willingly be ſeen abroad in a <hi>Fools-coat,</hi> why ſhould a modeſt Virgin walk the ſtreets in the garb of the debauched and proſtitute? Or, if they will needs do it, let them not be angry if others judg them as bad as thoſe whom they are ambitious to imitate. I could wiſh therefore, tho with ſmall hopes to ſee it take effect, That as once there was a Proclamation, That <hi>all Curtezans ſhould be known by their ſtriped Veil;</hi> ſo we had the ſame, or ſome like Law revived, That there ſhould be a viſible Mark of Diſcrimination between two ſuch contrary Parties.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. That Apparel which we find to gratifie, or awaken corruption in our own ſouls, tho it may be no ſin in it ſelf, nor in another, to whom it is no ſuch temptation, is a ſin for us to wear. We are commanded to <hi>make no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.14</note> In vain do we complain that the fire burns and rages, if we pour Oyl into the flame to feed it. Take away the fuel, and the fire goes out of it ſelf. If we were true to our own ſouls, we might find how difficult, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to wear gorgeous Apparel, and not be proud of it; to wear gaudy Apparel, and not to feel ſome Vanity awaken within us: that God who forbids any ſin, forbids all fomentations of it, all incitements to it. If then any Apparel, or Mode of Apparel, ſhall cheriſh, or excite Luſt in the heart, whatever it is to others, it is ſin to him to whom it becomes ſuch a provocation. What comfort is it to ſee another drink a Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without harm, when thou already feeleſt thy ſelf poyſoned by it?</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Whatever becomes a bait to ſin in another, ought to be worn with great caution; and the ends of the wearer, and the wear it ſelf, to be duly conſidered. In order to which I lay down theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. <hi>To deſign evil, tho the effect follow not, is ſinful.</hi> The heart is often criminal, when the hand is not, cannot be ſo. He that hunts for the precious Life, is a Murderer, tho God break the neck of, and defeat the Murder. A Man may conceive Miſchief, which he cannot bring forth, becauſe Providence makes it abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And by this Rule all they are caſt, who uſe, or abuſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apparel for unlawful ends, tho they happily miſcarry in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſition</hi> 2. <hi>An evil that is the effect of its proper cauſe, is imputed to him that gave, or laid the cauſe, tho he deſigned not actually the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> We are reſponſible to God for all the evil that <hi>naturally and neceſſarily</hi> flows from our actions, whatever our deſigns are, or may be. And the Reaſon is, becauſe it is ſuppoſed that we do know, in as much as we ought to know, all the natural and neceſſary Moral
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:42587:269" rendition="simple:additions"/> Products of our own actions. And this will condemn ſome of our filthy Faſhions, which of themſelves produce theſe accurſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. And tho God can bring good out of evil, or reſtrain the evil, that it follow not from that which otherwiſe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it; yet becauſe <hi>we</hi> cannot, it is evil in us not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>

            <p>The moſt compendious way of reforming Perſons, Families, Nations, and Churches, is to begin at, and deal with the heart; as the ſhorteſt way to fell the Tree, is by ſound blows at the root.

For tho <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt formed, <hi>Eve</hi> firſt ſinned, and ſo infeſted all with <hi>Original ſin.</hi> However (as one notes<note n="f" place="margin">Teſtard de Nat. &amp; Gratia.

Yet that the Female Sex <hi>at home,</hi> may not deſpond under the ſenſe of that ſuffering which <hi>Eves</hi> forwardneſs to ſin had more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially brought upon them; the <hi>Apoſtle here</hi> in theſe heartning words, prepares a moſt ſweet and ſtrengthning <hi>ſpiritual Cordial,</hi> for the chearing up of all good Women, and the clearing of their eyes from fumes in fainting fits. And therein it eminently concerns <hi>Child-bearing</hi> ones, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py out the moſt approv'd <hi>Receipt</hi> in the comfortable Expreſſions of the <hi>Gentile Doctor,</hi> That tho they <hi>breed</hi> and <hi>bear children</hi> with much trouble, which may argue God's diſpleaſure in his Sentence, and is indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the firſt ſin, which they are very ſenſible of in the Antecedents, Concomitants, and Conſequents of their ſore Labour, that may (as it ſometimes hath done in <hi>Rachael,</hi> and <hi>Phineas his Wife,</hi> &amp;c.) bring their bodies, or their Babes, if not both to the Grave; yet the Pains ſhall be ſanctified, and be no obſtacle to their welfare; their ſouls ſhall be ſafely deliver'd.</p>
            <p>The [<hi>Notwithſtanding</hi>] in the front of the <hi>Text,</hi> doth, my thinks, <hi>Rhetorically</hi> uſher in a comfortable <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a tacit <hi>Objection</hi> which might ariſe in the minds of thoſe Women who were without ſufficient Reaſon but too much addicted to a ſingle life, or over-fearful of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, <hi>partly</hi> from the ſorrow upon Conception, and in Child-bearing, and <hi>partly</hi> from that kind of ſubjection in converſation, which (with more reluctancy) the apoſtacy of the Woman, and thereupon the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence denounc'd againſt her, did introduce. For <hi>the Wiſdom from above,</hi> according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, thus ſweetly and graciouſly reſolves the doubt, That if a Womans ſubjection in converſation be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, her ſorrow upon conception ſhall be ſweetned; if her life be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tho her throws and pangs be grievous, yet ſhe ſhall have ſurpaſſing <hi>joy that a child is born;</hi> and if ſhe dies in <hi>child-bearing,</hi> her ſoul will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy. So that in the doleful ſtate, and hard condition of <hi>child-bearing pain,</hi> whereinto the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of <hi>Eve</hi> hath brought <hi>her</hi> (whoſe <hi>Sex</hi> the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law<note n="e" place="margin">Levit. 12, 5, 8,</note> ſuppoſeth to be under greater weakneſs and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs); which makes even Chriſtian married Wives more ſuſpicious and fearful upon their conception; here is a ground of good hope, All ſhall go well with them, who may hence take encouragement as to their Temporal ſaſe deliverance (even as to any other Temporal good thing) in the due exerciſe of Chriſtian Graces. Yea, and here's matter of great ſupport, and ſtrong conſolation<note n="*" place="margin">Danaeus in loc.

            <p>'Tis plain then we have in theſe excellent <hi>words</hi> (imply'd and expreſs'd) theſe <hi>two things:</hi> as,</p>
            <p n="1">I. A <hi>Womans weakneſs</hi> by the Fall <hi>imply'd</hi> to be, a more uneaſie <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and <hi>child-bearing.</hi> So,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Her ſupport and ſtrength,</hi> as to the ground of it, by Grace <hi>expreſs'd,</hi> both in reſpect to the <hi>end,</hi> by removing the impediment: <hi>ſhe ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and ſav'd notwithſtanding;</hi> and <hi>way</hi> or means, by <hi>continuance</hi> in Grace, or keeping her Ornament, to evidence her Title; and that ſhines with the <hi>four</hi> Jewels of <hi>Faith, Charity, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Womans weakneſs</hi> by the Fall, is here <hi>implied</hi> to be, a more uneaſie <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and painful <hi>child-bearing,</hi> may be apparent from the <hi>precedent verſes.</hi> For it ſhould ſeem before the Fall, when there was an admirable Harmony in the whole frame of Nature, <hi>Woman</hi> ſhould have bred and brought forth with eaſineſs, and her ſubjection to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of her Husband ſhould have been more liberal, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittency, or diſcomfort. Whereas now ſince that ſaddeſt accident, by reaſon of the imperfection which ariſeth from ſin, the woman is, as it were, untun'd, and enclin'd to account this inflicted ſubjection to her Husband, grievous to <hi>her,</hi> who had given the worſt counſel, and doth find the many illneſſes which occur in breeding, very troubleſome; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the pangs of the approaching birth, very terrible; yea, and ſometimes from the fearful apprehenſions ſhe hath of the Curſe, next to intollerable<note n="*" place="margin">Miſerima miſeria quod maximo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo &amp; tantum non moribunda enititur foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Luth. in <hi>Gen. 3.16.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Apoſtle expreſly mentions the Womans ſupport and ſtrength</hi> by grace, in that condition, both with reference to the <hi>end,</hi> preſervation and ſalvation [<hi>ſhe ſhall be ſav'd in child-bearing</hi>]; and the <hi>way</hi> or means to attain it, <hi>if they continue in Faith, and Charity, and Holineſs, with Sobriety.</hi> Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 19.8.</note>. This, this is the principal thing; the Grace of <hi>Faith, Charity, Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> ſpeak true Chriſtian prudence. And if you therefore take <hi>care</hi> to put on theſe, you will be the moſt ſurely guided in a ſubordinate <hi>care</hi> about other circumſtances. And if God hath given any of you real proof already of performing his promiſe in my <hi>Text,</hi> by vouchſafing <hi>temporal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> to you, it behoves you to take <hi>care,</hi> [2.] <hi>To record the Experiments he hath given you of making good his word to you in particular.</hi> Hath God vanquiſh'd your <hi>fears,</hi> wip'd away your <hi>tears,</hi> and heard your <hi>prayers?</hi> Engrave the Memorials of his <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> upon the tables of your hearts.

               <bibl>

               </bibl>
               <q>For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul. Or what ſhall a man give in Exchange for his Soul?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the Twenty firſt verſe of this Chapter, our Saviour foretels his ſufferings, together with many conſiderable Circumſtances; as the Place where, at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> The Perſons from whom, the <hi>Elders and chief Prieſts, and Scribes:</hi> The Degree unto which he muſt ſuffer; not only that he muſt ſuffer <hi>many things,</hi> but that he was to ſuffer unto death, and <hi>be killed:</hi> by which enumeration of ſo many particulars, he ſpake more plainly, and preached to them the unwelcome Doctrine of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>A Doctrine ſo ſtrange unto them, as they had ſhewn themſelves of a quite contrary Opinion, expecting a worldly Kingdom, and hoping for conſiderable advancement in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> in the name of the reſt, therefore cavils at it, and enveighs againſt it; and was probably ſuffered to be tempted himſelf, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Tempter to our Saviour, that he might not be exalted above meaſure for what our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Bleſſed Saviour, who had overcome the Devils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they came immediately from himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. could not be overcome by them, now they are ſuggeſted to him by another; but ſhews that he continued his Reſolution of ſuffering the utmoſt for us, by his ſevere check given unto <hi>Peter</hi> under a ſmart compellation, <hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that very ſame Apoſtle, who but a few verſes before, had his Name chang'd from <hi>Simon</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> and preſently after here from <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> to ſhew how much he and all other differ, when mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted by Gods Grace and Spirit, from themſelves, when left to themſelves; and become as other, if not worſe than other men.</p>
            <pb n="914" facs="tcp:42587:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And how eaſily do we ſlide into ſin at unawares, and <hi>how carefully need we to watch over our very zeal for Chriſt, and Goodneſs, when our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt Affections are ſubject to ſo groſs miſtakes,</hi> and may deſerve ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reproofs?</p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion it was that our Saviour in ſtead of retracting his former reſolves, declares that he was not to be alone in them, but they ſhould all come to be of his mind; and be conformed to his Will. Nay, that if they would be his Diſciples in deed <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>If any man will come after me, i. e.</hi> be in deed my Diſciple; (alluding to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and cuſtom of the Eaſtern Countreys, when the Maſter, or Rabbi was wont to go with his Scholers attending after him) he muſt not only forego his Eaſe, and reſign his Will, but leave his life (in theſe things denying of himſelf, as if his preſent pleaſure, or advantage were to be conſidered no longer of) when they ſtood in oppoſition to Gods Glory, or our Souls good.</p>
            <p>And this is not only, or barely aſſerted, but convincingly proved; leaſt the Diſciples ſhall cry again, <hi>this is a hard ſaying,</hi> (as if ever they had cauſe to ſay ſo, they had on this occaſion:) Our Bleſſed Saviour is willing to abide the Tryal upon this Iſſue, and to have it judged and determin'd by themſelves. Appealing in the words of the Text to their rational and wiſe faculties, <hi>For what is a man profited if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words, as to the <hi>form</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Judgment, and Conſciences are called upon, (being we do ſo often vilifie our Souls, and preferr the little things of this world, now one thing, then another; before them) to ſhew cauſe for our ſo doing, and to bring forth our ſtrong Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Of all ſorts and ways of arguing, this came moſt home, and is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt: when we are allowed to be as it were both Judge and Party; and yet muſt condemn our ſelves.</p>
            <p>This manner of Speech is only uſed when the caſe is very plain and obvious: And we care not who hear it, or determine it.</p>
            <p>Thus God calls upon the <hi>Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and men of Judah to judge betwixt him and his Vineyard.</hi> Iſa. 5.3. His Vineyard were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Figure, and God is willing the caſe ſhould be referred to their own determination; if they would give themſelves time and leiſure to think of it: So <hi>Amos</hi> 2.11. <hi>Is it not even thus O ye Children of Iſrael ſaith the Lord?</hi> as if God had ſaid, I call your own Conſciences to witneſs, and let them but ſpeak, they will teſtifie both my Mercies to you, and your ſins againſt me; or as elſewhere, Ezek. 18.25. <hi>Are not my wayes equal, and your wayes unequal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And oh that men would conſider how ſelf-condemned they muſt needs be for all their ſins againſt God, and all their neglects of Salvation, and diſregards of their Souls; their ſins uſually go thus beforehand unto Judgment, and men cannot but condemn themſelves, who can think but that a humble, uſeful, temperate, pious Life is far better
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:42587:293" rendition="simple:additions"/> than a proud, uſeleſs, luxurious and prophane Converſation? Would we but <hi>ſhew our ſelves men</hi> in the concerns of our Souls, as we do in thoſe of our Bodies or Eſtates, acting with that caution, and concern in the one, as we do in the other; what a vaſt change ſhould we ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? for all Gods Commandments are for our good, and his ways are pleaſantneſs, would we but ſeriouſly view and conſider them.</p>
            <p>Howſoever this is that which will make the Worm to gnaw, and the fire to burn the ungodly in the other World; in that they have ſinn'd againſt thoſe notices of good and evil which they had, or might have had; and in that they have put no difference between their vile bodies, and their precious Souls; whereas our Saviour here appeals to them concerning the worth of their Souls, and the worthleſneſs of all things comparatively beſides.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the form or manner of expreſſion here uſed by way of a poſitive interrogation, or Expoſtulation: <hi>What is a man profited? or what ſhall a man give?</hi> We obſerve that the Negation is intended to be more vehement. It being uſual not only in Scripture, but in common ſpeech; by a poſitive queſtion vehemently to deny, as by a negative queſtion vehemently to affirm any thing, as by theſe Scriptures before quoted, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.11, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. amongſt many other places may appear: ſo that the ſenſe of theſe words amounts to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is moſt evident, and undeniable that if any man could gain the whole World (not that ſuch a thing was ever done, or is indeed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but) upon that ſuppoſition, he would be a vaſt loſer by it, if he loſt his Soul for it. Becauſe</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is nothing of worth or value ſufficient to exchange for a Soul with all.</p>
            <p>Now this Text is as it were a ballance, or pair of Scales, in which the Commodities therein ſpoken of, are weighed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the one Scale is layd the whole world;<note place="margin">1 Jo. 2.16.</note> here you may take in the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, or whatſoever ſerves for Pleaſure, Gain, or Honour, (the worldly man's Trinity.) Abate nothing, make good weight, more than was ever weighed out to any one; but ſuppoſed or granted only for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake: Yet here is a <hi>Mene: Mene</hi> writ againſt it, it is weighed, and found too light. It is touched, and found under value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the other Scale only a ſingle Soul, is put (yours, or mine;) and that doth ſo far praeponderate, and outweigh, or outvie the whole World, as that there is no compariſon betwixt them, nothing is of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to be given, or taken in Exchange for any of them. As to the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer of theſe, the World, and the Glory of it: Our preſent purpoſe is to take no further notice of it.</p>
            <q>Sic tranſit gloria mundi.</q>
            <p>The Moon is not worth the looking after whilſt the Sun appears, nor all theſe fading changeable things, when the Soul comes under
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:42587:294" rendition="simple:additions"/> conſideration.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</note> It is now expected that the World ſhould be crucified to us, and we to the World; and then only we ſhall be able to hear, <hi>i. e.</hi> to underſtand what our Saviour here ſays concerning our Souls, which being my intended Subject: I ſhall take occaſion from his words to ſpeak to theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What is meant by the Soul here ſpoken of?</item>
               <item>2. What this Soul here ſpoken of, is?</item>
               <item>3. In what (more particularly) the worth of this Soul does appear?</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> What is meant by the Soul.</note>What is meant by a Soul, in the Text? To mention no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the word than ſuch as may be accommodated to this place, and our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Soul (or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the word here uſed) is put for Life; by a <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy of the Efficient for the Effect,</hi> becauſe our Life depends upon the Soul; thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. take no thought for your Lives; when the ſame word is uſed, which is here tranſlated Soul; which well conſidered, will give a great light into the meaning of this place.</p>
            <p>For theſe words are looked upon as a proverbial Speech taken out of <hi>Job</hi> 2.4. <hi>All that a man hath will he give for his Life.</hi> As if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had from thence inferr'd, if a man being in an apparent danger of a corporal Death, would give any thing, or do any thing to prolong or redeem his Life; how much more ſhould a man do or part with to prevent an Eternal Death, or to procure an Everlaſting Life?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The word Soul is put for the Whole Man <hi>(Synecdoche Partis)</hi> frequently in Scripture; thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.26. The number of Perſons that came with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> are reckon'd by <hi>ſo many Souls,</hi> as alſo <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. They that were Converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>three thouſand Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This if conſidered, furthers our preſent purpoſe, and muſt needs add to our eſteem of our Souls; for the Soul is the Man. Our Souls are our ſelves; and what by this Evangeliſt our Saviour calls <hi>loſing of the Soul:</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.25. That Evangeliſt relating the ſame thing, calls <hi>loſing of our ſelves.</hi> The Body is but the Houſe or Cabinet, the Soul is the Jewel in it; the Body is but the cloathing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that the Soul for a while is cloathed with, and muſt put off.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) This word Soul is taken moſt properly and ſtrictly for the Form, conſtituent, and better part of Man; that Breath that is brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into him from God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.</note> when Man becomes a Living Soul. And in this acception we ſhall take this word here in our following Diſcourſe, and are come to enquire what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> What this Soul is.</note>But we ſhall not be throughly able to ſatisfie our inquiry; for being all our knowledge ariſeth from our Sences, and there is nothing in our Underſtanding, which was not firſt in one of them. Our Souls not incurring into our Senſes, Our underſtanding is at a loſs to frame any adaequate conceptions of them.</p>

            <p>There are three things reckoned amongſt the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſuch things as cannot be known, and by conſequence be defined, and they are 1. <hi>God,</hi> 2. <hi>Angels,</hi> 3. <hi>Humane Souls:</hi> and this does very much ſet forth the Excellency of our Souls; that they are only to be known as God himſelf, or the Angels are to be known; that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By way of Eminency:</hi> When we affirm that <hi>Being</hi> is in a more excellent manner in them, than in any viſible thing.</p>

Yet we may ſo far define a Humane Soul, as to expreſs the Conception which we have of it. I ſhall only ſet down St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> definition of ſuch a Soul.<note place="margin">libr. de immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitate animae.</note> 
               <hi>Eſt ſubſtantia quaedam rationis particepss, regendo Corpori accommodata. It is a rational ſubſtance, fitted for the government of the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe as it is ſaid of God, it may be ſaid of the Soul; <hi>None hath ſeen a Soul at any time:</hi> and therefore as there are many that ſay there is no God. So there are as many which ſay there is no Soul (both having the ſame Friends and Enemies, the very ſame affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers or denyers) I ſhall be more particular in ſeveral concluſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject, our Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. VVe aſſert that <hi>the Soul is a diſtinct ſubſtance from the Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. The Soul is a diſtinct ſubſtance from the Body.</note> which will appear if we conſider that ſuch things as are proper to diſtinct ſubſtances (as to dwell in the body whilſt a man lives, to leave the body when he dyes,) are attributed to the Soul; and this is not the ſaying or opinion of ſome one, or a few perſons, who though emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, might be ſingular and opine according to their fancies or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; but it hath been at all times, and in all Nations (as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal tradition) held undeniably by all conſidering, and thinking men, and they ſpeak accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Soul is a ſubſtance and diſtinct from the Body, appears in that it does <hi>ſubſtare, i. e.</hi> is the Subject of Accidents, ſuch as are Vertue, and Vice, Arts and Sciences; which cannot inhere in bare matter. It is not from the Body that a Man is Learned or Ignorant, but from his Mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Soul is thus diſtinct from the Body, in that it was made after the Body. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the Creating of the Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly after the forming of the Body: Gen. 2.7. <hi>And the Lord God formed man of the duſt of the Earth,</hi> that is, his Body, which was duſt, and ſhall return to duſt; and then he adds, he <hi>breathed into his Noſtrils the breath of Life.</hi> His Body or Noſtrils were made before the Soul was breathed into him; and his Soul was breathed into him by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Act of Divine Power from that which made his Body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Soul of Man is a different ſubſtance from his Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does exiſt ſeparately from the Body. Though I will not ſay with the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> that the Souls of Man had a being before their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:42587:295" rendition="simple:additions"/> Yet it is certain they continue their being after that they have left their Bodies; this the wiſer Heathen were not wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, whoſe Teſtimonies (as all things of that Nature upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I forbear to meddle with) are full, and plain in this Caſe. It ſuffices us Chriſtians that our Lord and Maſter ſuppoſes this as moſt certain in the Parable of the rich Glutton, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19, 20.) in which there are no leſs than three inſtances to prove the Souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence after the Death of the Body. <hi>Abraham, Dives,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and though this is indeed a Parable, and Symbolical Scripture is not Argumentative. Yet ſo far muſt be granted true, as may make a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the ſcope and intent for which it was ſpoken.</p>
            <p>But what is beyond any cavil or exception. Our Saviour tells the Thief upon the Croſs, Luk. 23.43. <hi>Verily to day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> It is certain his <hi>Body</hi> was not with our Saviours; that it might appear our Saviour (not any other) did ariſe, God ſo provided, that he was laid in a new Tomb, in which none ever was laid before; Neither could our Saviour mean that he ſhould be with his God-head in Paradiſe that day; for at that very inſtant in which he ſpake, in that place, and in all places Chriſt as God is preſent. Had this man gone to Hell, the words in this ſenſe had been true, but not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this dying Confeſſor. They can only therefore relate to his Souls going to the place of the Bleſſed, when it ſhould that day leave its Body.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. The Soul is a Spiritual ſubſtance.</note>2. We may advance a little further towards the knowledge of our Souls, in aſſerting that <hi>they are Spiritual, or Spirits,</hi> freed from that compoſition, and thoſe druggs that are in matter, which clogs, and debaſe it; and it is no ſmall perfection of the Soul that it is freed from them: My meaning is, The Soul of man is not the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">libr. de im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitate ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</note> or Craſis of the Body. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinks that every one may eaſily be convinced of this in himſelf, <hi>Quis bene ſe inſpiciens, &amp;c. Who,</hi> ſays he, <hi>conſidering himſelf, does not find that he underſtands any thing he ponders on the better, the more he can withdraw his thoughts from ſenſible Objects. Quod ſi temperatio corporis eſſet animus, non utique id poſſit accidere.</hi> If the Soul were the Temper of the Body, it would not fall out thus, for bodily or ſenſible things would help them, rather than hinder the Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall be ingaged to a further proof of it which theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments may evince. VVere it only that the Soul is ſo often called a Spirit (by God himſelf in his word.) It were a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Argument to prove that it is a Spirit.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Plato <hi>in</hi> Crat.</note> When <hi>Adam</hi> gave all the Creatures Names, who doubts but that thoſe Names were ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Natures? And could that Nomenclature be retrived, it might tell us more of Beaſts and Fowls than is yet, or it may be now ever will be known.</p>
            <p>But when God ſpeaks ſo often of a Soul under the notion of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and in many places where a Metaphorical ſenſe will not ſerve the turn, we cannot but know that the Soul is what God calls it, as well as the Creatures were what <hi>Adam</hi> called them.</p>
            <pb n="919" facs="tcp:42587:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>To name but a few Texts: The wiſe man ſpeaking of the Soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Calls it the ſpirit,</hi> and ſays it <hi>returns to God that gave it,</hi> in contradiſtinction to the Body, which he calls there <hi>duſt:</hi> and if <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> knew the ſeveral Creatures, from the Cedar to the Hyſope, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was not ſo ignorant of the nature of his Soul, as to ſpeak ſo impertinently if it be not a Spirit.</p>
            <p>Nay it is one of <hi>Gods Titles, Zech.</hi> 12.1. <hi>ult. That he formeth the ſpirit of man within him:</hi> Which proves its diſtinction from the Body, and its ſpiritual Nature too: and if mans Soul were only as the Soul of a Beaſt, the forming of it would not deſerve to be reckoned up with thoſe ſtupendous Acts <hi>of ſtretching out the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>laying the foundations of the Earth;</hi> as we ſee it is in the forecited place.</p>
            <p>Add to this that when our Bleſſed Saviour dyed, the Evangeliſt ſays he <hi>gave up the Ghoſt. Matth.</hi> 27.50. that is, his Spirit or Soul: And St. <hi>Stephen</hi> dyed with theſe laſt words, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> Acts 7.59.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Soul is a ſpiritual ſubſtance, is evident, in that it is not produced out of matter; as the Body of <hi>Adam</hi> was, and all our Bodies are; as is obſerved in the Relation we have of mans Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Obſervation upon it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death, (after his moſt admired deſcription of Old Age) then ſays he <hi>ſhall the duſt, i. e.</hi> the body, <hi>return to the Earth as it was;</hi> there is the Original of that aſſign'd, and the <hi>ſpirit ſhall return to God that gave it.</hi> The Spirit or Soul is as certainly made by God out of no praeexiſting matter, as the Body is made out of matter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23.</note> and if we grant the one, why ſhould we doubt of the other? To be ſure, when <hi>Eve</hi> was brought unto <hi>Adam,</hi> he ſays ſhe is <hi>now bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> but he does not ſay ſhe is a <hi>Soul of my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Soul be made by God, <hi>mediante Generatione,</hi> or by an immediate Creation, (though I am perſwaded of the latter, yet) I ſhall not peremptorily determine,<note place="margin">Nec tum ſcit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam, nec adhuc ſcio <hi>Auguſt.</hi> libr. <hi>1. Retr.</hi>
               </note> finding St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in a plainer caſe concerning the Soul, modeſtly profeſſing his Ignorance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third Argument to prove the Soul is a Spirit, is, becauſe in it man bears <hi>the Image of God. God is a Spirit, John</hi> 4.24. and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing corporeal, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> can be ſaid to be in his Image or Likeneſs: Neither is any bodily thing as bodily, capable of Wiſdom, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, by which man reſembles his Maker.</p>
            <p>Now though theſe Scripture-proofs are ſufficient to any that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve undoubtedly the verity of Scripture, (and ſuch I ſpeak to) yet to name one or two of another Nature; Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The Actions or Operations of the Soul are ſuch, as cannot proceed from any bodily Being; as intellection, and volition; To abſtract and reflect upon its ſelf, and its motions. In one thought to meditate on Hell, in the next on Heaven. No Corporeal Agent can in leſs than the twinkling of an Eye, or turn of a hand move, or act on things ſo vaſtly diſtant. The Opinion of the motion of the Orbs of the Planets and of the Firmament is antiquated, and almoſt
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:42587:296" rendition="simple:additions"/> laught at becauſe no Bodies can be conceived to move ſo ſwiftly: and this motion of the Soul incredibly exceeds theirs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The Soul is a Spirit, in that it is <hi>in the Body,</hi> and <hi>one Body cannot be in another, non datur penetratio corporum.</hi> The Soul takes up no place as bodies do, 'tis <hi>tota in toto</hi> or at leaſt negatively. It is not by parts in the Body, as material things are; part here, and part there; whereas the Soul is ſo in any part, that it is not the leſs in the other: Thus theſe being premiſed</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. In what the Souls Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency does appear.</note>I come now to that which is mainly intended, <hi>viz. to ſhew whence we may know the excellency of the Soul;</hi> For as to ſome other particulars which may tend to the further explaining the Text. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How a Soul may be ſaid to be loſt.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What this Phraſe, giving an exchange for the Soul;</hi> imports, I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeak to them as they will fall with what we are yet to ſpeak unto, For I would not make the Porch or Entry too large or wide.</p>
            <p>Though I may ſuppoſe that in what I have ſaid enough may be diſcovered to prove what I am upon, and that I have laid down ſuch Principles as the worth of the Soul may eaſily be inferr'd from them. Yet it will not be amiſs to be minded of the force of them, with the addition of ſuch things as will abundantly ſerve our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. In its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</note>The firſt thing that ſpeaks the Souls Prerogative, is its Original. It is accounted no ſmall priviledge to be nobly born, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Princes, or Perſons Eminent in any kind, yet man in <hi>his beſt Eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> Pſ. 39.5. <hi>Man is a worm,</hi> Job. 25.6. and the Son of man (be he who he will) is but a Worm, his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is univocal, and like begets its like. But the Soul is <hi>the Off-ſpring of God.</hi> Acts 17.29. In that ſenſe the <hi>Heathen Poet,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> from him is to be underſtood, there is no pretence for the Body to be the Off-ſpring of God, who is a Spirit. If it be warily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we may admit of what is ordinarily ſaid of the Soul, that it is <hi>divinae aurae particula,</hi> I am ſure 'tis this part only in man that may be ſaid to partake of the Divine Nature. (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.)</p>
            <p>'Tis remarkable that the Soul at its Creation was not made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any pattern, or ſampler taken from amongſt the herd of the viſible Creatures, but 'tis a kind of an <hi>Idea</hi> of God, as true, and as full a one; as in matter can be borne, and though man be lower than the Angels by reaſon of his Body which is as a clog upon the Soul, or a flaw which this precious Jewel appears with. Yet in ſome reſpect the Humane Nature may vy with the Angelical Nature, and man is the Crown and Topſtone of the Creation; being added laſt of all by the all-wiſe <hi>Architect</hi> to his building of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">In the End 'tis deſign'd for.</note>2. The Excellency of our Souls appears from the End they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for. It cannot but ſpeak the dignity of the Soul, that it alone,

            <p n="1">1. The Soul of Man is <hi>made for to bring glory to God;</hi> Not as the body of Man, only as an Inſtrument, which moves as the Soul would have it, as the Ax in the hand of the Workman, nor as the other viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures who glorifyed God only as they afford us matter for Gods glory; but all the Glory that God expects, or can reap from all and every one of the Corporal Beings is entruſted with Man. Man is the Creatures High Prieſt, and by him they offer up all their Sacrifices of Praiſe and Thanks. When in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. the Sun and Moon, nay, Storms and Tempeſts are call'd upon to praiſe God, Man is cited to meditate on, and to glorify God for his Wiſdom and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which appear in them. And indeed were it not for the Soul of man, God ſhould have made all the reſt of the Creatures for nought; Man is only concern'd in them, and benefited by them; and his Soul only able to bleſs God for them.</p>
            <p>All Gods works of Creation, nay, and of Providence too, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of praiſe, ſo <hi>done,</hi> as <hi>they ought to be had in remembrance. (Pſ.</hi> 111.4.) When we contemplate or meditate upon them, they afford our Souls great cauſe to be enlarged in our praiſing of ſeveral of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God: All things are <hi>Deo plena.</hi> All things have a voice as well <hi>as day</hi> and night. <hi>The Heavens and the Firmament, Pſ.</hi> 19.1, 2. They ſpeak God to be Almighty, and abundant in goodneſs; they tell us, as often as we view or conſider them, that God who made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them is worthy of all our Fear, and Love, Service and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is only the Soul of man that is able to read, hear, or underſtand theſe things; and therefore man for his Souls ſake (as the Prieſts had) have many priviledges allotted to him by God. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 8.6.) who hath put the other Creatures (generally) under his feet.</p>
            <p>It is ſadly true that men rob God of his Honour they are entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</p>
            <p>Ah whoſe Soul is a faithful Steward of Gods manifold gifts? What Sacriledge do not men commit dayly? And may we lay it to heart? For God will call Heaven and Earth elſe to witneſs againſt us. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature, and Providence can teſtifie they contained matter enough to excite our praiſes, and to perſwade our Obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again the Soul of man is made capable to enjoy God, to ſee God, that is, to know him, and love him, in whoſe preſence there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.11.) The Sun and Planets, with the reſt of the ſpangles of Heaven know not their Maker, nor what they are, nor to what end they ſerve; they, (how bright ſoever) are not recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that light that ſhines into the hearts; and upon the Souls of
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:42587:297" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Children of Men; if compared with which, their brighteſt beam is thick darkneſs, were it only for our <hi>viaticum</hi> (the repaſt we have on the road towards Heaven.)</p>
            <p>The Soul indeed ſees here as <hi>through a glaſs darkly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and knows but in part, yet this very taſte is better than the full meal that any other Creature can make: Yet it muſt be confeſſed that <hi>anima ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le habitat,</hi> the Soul is uneaſie in this World, not only with grieves and cares, but becauſe 'tis out of its place, as a bone out of joynt. It was made to be with God, and cannot be ſatisfyed when it is from God. But what an excellent Creature muſt that be, whom the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God of Glory ſhould thus delight to honour: which God ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (may I ſpeak ſuch a word) chooſe for his Companion: I am ſure we are ſaid to have <hi>fellowſhip with him.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. VVhatſoever the Soul was before, by chooſing and admitting it into his preſence, God makes it glorious.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that inferiour Creatures are ſatisfyed with food ſuitable to them; they have ſaved their End, and have gone to the utmoſt of their line, according to the Law of their Creation, to their Creators praiſe; But the Soul of man is upon the Rack, and hath a thouſand torments till it anſwers his end, <hi>Irrequietum eſt cor meum donec venit ad te;</hi> until it brings actively ſome Glory unto God, and comes in ſome meaſure to the enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p>That Life, or Soul, which inferiour Creatures have, keeps indeed their bodies from putrifying; but man hath not <hi>animam pro Sale:</hi> His Soul only as ſalt to keep his Body from ſtinking; but to act and govern it that it may be an Inſtrument in the ſervice, and to the praiſe of God, and by reaſon of this, his Tongue, and every Member may be made his Glory, when 'tis imployed to the Glory of God. It is certainly a debaſement of the Soul to buſy it about Eating and Drinking, Dreſſing, or Undreſſing (further than what is neceſſary to our preſervation and our paſſage through this world as Pilgrims and Strangers.) as we think Children to imploy their Souls ill whilſt they make Pyes of dirt; or run after gay pubbles made up of froth or ſtime: Only here is the difference, young ones are ſcarce capable of knowing or doing better, the wings of their Souls ſeem not fledged, but afterwards God juſtly expects that we ſhould fly higher, and we are able to ſoar above the third Heavens; and in our Thoughts, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Affections to go to God; <hi>to taſte and ſee how good that he is, Pſ.</hi> 34.8.</p>

               </gap> or exchange for a Soul; 'tis a Phraſe borrowed from former times, when men did not pay in coin for what they bought, but did exchange Commodity for Commodity, (as yet in ſome of our Iſlands <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and it does imply, that there is nothing, no, not the World, that bears a parity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with the Soul. Now though this be moſt certainly true, that our
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:42587:298" rendition="simple:additions"/> Soul out-vyes in worth the whole World: (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.) Yet the Blood of Chriſt, which is the Blood of God (by reaſon of the Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union of his Humane Nature with the Divine) is a ſufficient ranſome for all the Souls that ſhall believe in him; nay 'tis ſufficient, were it but applyed, for the whole World.</p>
            <p>But how highly does God prize a Soul, ſeeing that when they were to be purchaſed, he ask'd, and would receive no leſs a rate for it, from his own Son, than his Life-blood, and yet men barter it away (as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and the Prieſts did our Saviour for thirty pence) at what rate, how low ſoever the Devil and the World will give for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I might add unto God's giving of his Son for our Souls; his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>ſpirit to the Soul;</hi> and this too that it <hi>might not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life,</hi> that he who <hi>dwelt in the higheſt Heavens,</hi> and <hi>whom the Heaven of Heavens is not able to contain,</hi> ſhould dwell in the Soul, or Heart of man after a more excellent manner, than in the moſt glorious Temple that ever was made; and therefore it muſt as far exceed it. It is true, our Bodies are ſaid to be <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 19.) but they are only Temples of the Holy Ghoſt as they are the Bodies that are animated by ſuch Souls, otherwiſe they had been no more dignifyed than any other clay or earth.</p>
            <p>That God ſhould come, and knock, and ſtay, and wait for entrance into our Souls until (to ſpeak with Scripture after the manner of men,) his head is wet with the dew of the morning, and be grieved at any repulſe, unkindneſs, or denyal he meets with. Nay that God, where he is entertain'd, ſhould never leave or depart from a Soul: Nay, with his good will would not abſent himſelf for one moment from it; It muſt needs declare his great love unto it, and eſteem of it: Nay, by thus loving of it, he makes it worthy, and valuable, whatſoever it might otherwiſe have been.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's valuing of our Souls appears in the care and pains which he takes for our Souls dayly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he hath inſtituted means whereby he might come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Souls, nay, to ſtrengthen, and comfort them, and have communion with them. Theſe are his Ordinances, the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and Prayer. He is brought in by the Prophet as one <hi>riſing up early, and ſending his Meſſengers, and Miniſters: (Jer.</hi> 7.13, 25.) He neglects no time, with the very firſt he is as it were, ſeizing upon us, and crying to us, return, why will ye dye?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay ſecondly, <hi>He bears with us, and exerciſes a great deal of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards us;</hi> if ſo be he might at length gain our Souls; and ſays, when ſhall it once be? Every ſin we commit preſſeth God, as a Cart is preſſed with ſheaves. All the Patience and meekneſs in all the beſt of Creatures if joyn'd together, could not endure ſuch an indignity as eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ſin offers to God, but they would eaſe themſelves of ſuch a burden, which yet God endures multitudes of, only that his Long-ſuffering might be Salvation to our Souls. (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.)</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="925" facs="tcp:42587:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. Yet further, <hi>His bearing with the whole World of wicked men;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Blaſphemies, and open defyances of him, is only out of Love to ſome few Souls who ſerve, and fear him: Hence the Pſalmiſt ſays concerning the World, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3.) I bear up the Pillars of it. A gracious Soul is the true Atlas that keeps the World from falling. God, out of reſpect unto ſuch, withholds that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire that ſhall (when their number is made up) conſume it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, All the Providences of God, in which he worketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, are intended by him for the good of our Souls, and done by God out of reſpect unto them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his Mercies God would allure our Souls to love and ſerve him; (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.4.<note place="margin">Plaintus.</note>) theſe are the Cords of a man <hi>(quo magis extendas eo aſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt arctius)</hi> by theſe God would oblige and tye our Souls the cloſer unto him. Mercies are vocal, they all have a Language or Speech (which we ought to learn to underſtand) whereby they recommend God unto our Souls, and as they came from God; ſo for this purpoſe they came from him, that our Souls might by their means go to God, who indeed ſent them on that very errand to bring our Souls unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay the very Judgments of God in the World prove his value for our Souls, who rather than miſs of them, does this <hi>his ſtrange work. (Iſa.</hi> 28.21.) God does not afflict willingly, but rather than to be deprived of mens Souls, he will do that which he is ſo loath to come unto. Thus he does not only afflict the wicked, who obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo, to caution and inſtruct the Souls of his people, (as Princes Children are leſſoned when their Proxyes are whip'd) but he corrects his deareſt Children and Servants, though it goes to his heart, and <hi>he himſelf is afflicted in all their afflictions, (Iſa.</hi> 63.9.) Yet rather than their Souls ſhould periſh with the world, he is ready to do, nay to ſuffer any thing.</p>
            <p>But when all is ſaid, theſe are but a few ſhreds of what might be layd before you. God's Love to, and prizing of our Souls need not ſo much to be proved, I would hope that it is felt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But on the other ſide as <hi>God does endeavour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed by Satan for our Souls.</note> 
               <hi>ſo does Satan to gain the Soul; fas eſt &amp; ab hoſtes doceri.</hi> We may learn this from our greateſt Enemy, that our Souls are worth all our care and pains in keeping; being our Adverſary the Devil thinks no pains too great to get them; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>He goeth up and down, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> He compaſſes the Earth as we may read in the book of <hi>Job. (Job.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Job</hi> 2.2.) He had conſidered <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo conſiders all others, what temptation is likeſt to prevail; what their tempers, and diſtempers are: what traps will take ſome, and what ſnares others. He knows our beloved ſins, and dreſſes them up, ſo as we might be loath to part with them. He did not deſire to go into the herd of Swine, that he might deſtroy them; but that by that means he might tempt their owners, as indeed it took effect (the <hi>Gadarens</hi> preferring their Swine before their Souls or their Saviour.) When our Saviour came to caſt
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:42587:299" rendition="simple:additions"/> him out of any one, the Devil was tormented: Why art <hi>thou come to torment us</hi> they cry; it was not becauſe they were forced to leave their Bodies, but becauſe by that means he ſhould have no ſuch opportunity to miſchief their Souls: (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.28.) Oh this is <hi>a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Satan to be deprived of our Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a Sermon we hear, but this Evil One is ready to take away the ſeed as ſoon as ever it is ſown; (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19.) there is not a Prayer we make, but theſe <hi>fowls of air</hi> attend to light upon the Sacrifice, and hardly can they be driven away. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are, whatſoever we do, the Devil attends and waits for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us, that he might but gain our Souls.</p>
            <p>And oh that men were but ſo induſtrious to preſerve their Souls as Satan is to ruine them. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are upon thee, and doeſt thou ſleep? The Thieves are up that intend to rob thee, and doeſt not thou ariſe? Satan does not do all this for nothing, or for that which is worth but little: This Eagle does not catch at Flyes, he <hi>hunts for the precious Soul.</hi>

There is one Argument more to prove the Excellency of our Souls, and that <hi>is, if you conſider their duration or laſting.</hi> It is as a dead colour upon all the beauties and glories in the World that they are fading; there is a worm at the root of the Gourd which men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, and ſet with greateſt content under: Inſomuch as 'tis not yet reſolved whether our comfort is greater whilſt we have theſe outward things, or our grief when we part from them; to be ſure the one muſt needs bear proportion unto the other; and the more any thing is loved, the loather we are to leave it.</p>
            <p>Now that the Soul tranſcends in this reſpect the World and all that is in it. (It being to remain when they ſhall be no more,) may appear from the nature of the Soul, which admits not thoſe contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which acting upon one another, deſtroy their ſubject in which they are.

I am the leſs intent upon my proving of this, becauſe all think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men do grant it. Nay, it is an Antecedent verity to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, unleſs our Souls be immortal, our <hi>faith is vain:</hi> and all thoſe abſurdities will follow which the Apoſtle reckons up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. as the conſequents of denying the Reſurrection of the Body.</p>
            <p>Nay unleſs the Soul be immortal, <hi>all Religion is but impoſture,</hi> and we are deſign'd upon and abuſed when we are call'd upon, and perſwaded
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:42587:299" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the worſhipping and ſerving of God; ſo that it is indeed as neceſſary forus to believe our Souls to be immortal, as it is neceſſary for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God; and either a good man's hope, or a wicked mans fears are ſufficient Evidences of both. That there is another life, or a future ſtate after this life: <hi>a good man would not but believe, and a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot but believe:</hi> They are only inconſidering debauched men, whoſe Luſts and Sins have made it greatly their Intereſt, that they might dye like Beaſts, as well as they have lived like them: Who did ever ſeem to queſtion it? I ſay, <hi>ſeem to queſtion it,</hi> for their <hi>ſurda vulnera,</hi> the wounds that Conſcience makes in them, would not pierce ſo deep, nor look ſo ſadly, if they had ſuch a lenitive as the thoughts that they might not be felt in the other world.</p>
            <p>But oth <hi>Eternity, Eternity?</hi> What a ſhrill and diſmal noiſe do it make in a wicked man's ear (or heart rather) when heard or thought on, and on the contrary what melody is it to a gratious man, to hear that his Soul is immortal, and his Crown incorruptible.</p>

            <p>If our Souls be found unbelieving and impenitent, without Gods Image and favour, all the <hi>rich attire, and ſumptuous fare</hi> will not keep our Bodies, no more than they did <hi>Dives</hi> his Body from being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in thoſe flames that ſhall burn, and none can quench them; on the other ſide, if our Souls be ſanctified and accepted, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any preſent poverty, diſeaſe, or miſery, they ſhall hereafter ſit <hi>with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Shall I carry this a little further, it may be more home and cloſe unto you.</p>

               <hi>The welfare of the Body even in this life depends upon the Soul.</hi> As the caſe of thy Soul is, ſo are all thoſe very things that befal thy Body, even in this world.

Thy Soul is thy ſelf, and if thy Soul be bad, thou art bad thy ſelf, and how haſt thou deſerved ſo ill of thy ſelf, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt neglect thy ſelf, and care not what become of thy Soul, which is thy ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> when he beheld his numerous Army, wept; <hi>Oh</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>what a many here are that in a very ſhort ſpace, muſt yield to Death, and be devoured by VVorms.</hi> It is a far ſadder conſideration that ſuch multitudes of mens Souls are loſt, and periſh Eternally; and let the abounding of ſin ſpeak whether this be a cauſeleſs fear: When the Apoſtles heard that one of them, <hi>though but one,</hi> was the Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhould loſe his Soul: Every one of them was jealous over his Condition, and cryed out, <hi>Is it I, Is it I? (Matth.</hi> 26.22.) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell who particularly it is; yet I cannot but know there are many ſins that ſpeak men ripe for judgment; and many other ſins, which though they be not ſo notorious and viſible; are yet certainly as truly deſtructive and damnable. A leak in any part of the Ship may ſink it: And now oh that my words might reach your hearts. I ſpeak in the behalf of your pretious Souls. Theſe words are not about trifles, which you may conſider or neglect as you pleaſe, but as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid in the like caſe, Theſe <hi>words are your Life,</hi> and no leſs than Life or Death Eternal depends upon your receiving of them.</p>
               <p>When your Bodies are diſtemper'd, what ſending is there for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian? How are the ſymptoms of the Diſeaſe conſidered? Or if an Eſtate be doubtful, what counſel do we not take? What coſt and charge are we not at to enſure it? Yet we let our Souls run all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, yea, and unimaginable hazards without the leaſt care, to be
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:42587:301" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſure without ſuitable care to their worth or danger: and how can we any longer go for Chriſtians, or the Diſciples of him, who taught us here the pretiouſneſs of our Souls, and himſelf valued them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Whatſoever we may flatter our ſelves with, only ſuch as are of the ſame mind with him, ſhall have Salvation by him.</p>
               <p>It is high time then to be Exhorted,<note place="margin">3. Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> and prevailed with <hi>to ſuitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and diſpoſitions</hi> ſhall I ſay, or rather to ſuitable <hi>Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations</hi> unto what ye have heard; The truths that have been ſpoken unto, are not ſo much ſpeculative, as practical; they meet with little or no controverſie in the Theory, but in the practice of them. The Devil knows that, let men believe what they will concerning their Souls, he is ſure enough to obtain them, and that with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a more ſore condemnation, if they do not practice according to what they are convinc'd of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shew then that thou doeſt value and eſteem thy Soul,</hi> according to the worth and dignity. Children or Fools, or Barbarous <hi>Africans,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr Beads and Toyes before Gold and real Pearls, but it were folly and madneſs if we ſhould do ſo, and yet I am afraid we do worſe every day.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is the price the tempter offers, or perſwades to ſin with, remember that it is for thy Soul, if thou conſenteſt and yieldeſt the bargain is ſtruck, thou doeſt what in thee lies to give thy Soul, for the pleaſure or advantage of the ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> had an ill bargain, that loſt his Soul and his Saviour for thirty pence; though many ſell their Saviour, and their Souls too, cheaper every day, a goodly price, be it what it will. God gave his Son for thy Soul, and entruſted thee with it, and thou ungrateful, and vile wretch, doeſt barter it away for trifles. You know Nathan<hi>'s Parable of the Ew-Lamb,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.) ſo tenderly beloved by the right owner of it, and yet it was ſlain to <hi>entertain a ſtranger.</hi> That Parable reſpects more than <hi>David.</hi> Thou art the Man. Thy Soul is the beloved Lamb, and the Devil is the Stranger (whom to be ſure thou art no way concern'd to entertain) when thou ſinneſt, thou ſlayeſt this Ewe-Lamb to entertain and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this ſtranger. Oh that the Parallel might be carryed a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that ſome or other upon the reading of this would cry out with <hi>David, I have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if thou wouldeſt indeed value thy Soul, be perſwaded from what thou haſt heard, that all thoſe things which concern thy Soul, are far more excellent, than thoſe which concern thy Body, as for inſtance; That,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy Souls riches are the beſt riches,</hi> call'd by our Saviour <hi>true riches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to facilitate this duty.</note> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.11.) Ah that any ſhould be contentedly without them!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Souls pleaſures are the choiceſt pleaſures:</hi> True Joy is not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial thing that affects the countenance, and produces ſmiles or laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; many poor wretches in Bedlam are thus merrily mad; but <hi>res ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera eſt verum gaudium.</hi> The Heart is the ſeat of all our Affections, and ſo of our Joy; and nothing can rejoyce that, but the favour of God to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="932" facs="tcp:42587:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. <hi>The Souls honour is the trueſt honour,</hi> if <hi>honour</hi> be <hi>in honorante,</hi> what honour is it to have the applauſe or homage of ſorry, ſinful men? But it is God that delights to honour the Soul, and will put off his own glory upon it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing to vilifie the Body which is the other part we conſiſt of, and we overprize and value: it is enough to ſay with <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, quantumcunque excolatur caro eſt.</hi> Trim thy Body, pamper it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all thy care and pains upon it, 'tis but fleſh ſtill, twill be wormes meat, and by all thy carking and caring for it, thou art but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to feaſt thoſe contemptible Creatures more delicately, or if that will be ſome while firſt, yet I may ask you as <hi>Plato</hi> did one of his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, (who minded his Table and cheer) what he did <hi>mean to make his Priſon ſo ſtrong?</hi> Alas the Body is but the Priſon of the Soul; the Soul is at liberty only when it gets out of it: Let theſe things fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently come into your minds: To which add,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the <hi>miſeries and wants which concern the Body be ſo great,</hi> as indeed we eſteem them, and ſometimes feel them to be; what then <hi>are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and calamities of the Soul?</hi> (The Soul being ſo excellent) nay, the meaneſt humane Soul being more worth than all the Bodies in the world. Is there any pain which torments thy Body; how intolerable will the pain be that will torment thy Soul; the biting of a Scorpion, and the raging of fire are but faint reſemblances of it. If bodily hunger be ſo ſharp, (what did it not cauſe the poor Women in the ſiege of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> to do, or to part with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.26.) how intenſe is the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt in the Soul, whilſt yet we are under the diſpenſations of mercy; but if once God's offended Patience turns to Anger, who can endure to be ſcorched with the flames of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Pleaſures and advantages men have for the Bodies be ſo deſirable,</hi> Oh what are <hi>thoſe Pleaſures and advantages we have or may have for our Souls:</hi> For God hath provided for all his Creatures ſuitably to their Natures. The Herbs and Plants have Earth and dung; Beaſts have graſs to nouriſh them with. The Body of man is plentifully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the ſtore-houſe and ward-robe of the Creatures with food, and rayment; but there is nothing amongſt them all found good enough for the Soul: The Soul can only be ſatisfyed with <hi>the good things of Gods houſe, even of his holy Temple. Pſal.</hi> 65.4. Or as <hi>David</hi> ſays elſewhere, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.15. <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfyed with thy likeneſs.</hi>

                     </gap>hich we muſt practice this duty.</note>But that I may not be only in generals, perſwading you to a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical valuation for your Souls; let the eſteem you have for your Souls appear in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Value thy ſelf upon the account of thy Soul:</hi> How do men ſtand upon their tip-toes, if they may by any means over-top others. This will almoſt make thy Pride commendable, if thou glorieſt only that thy Soul is ſo near akin, ſo much alike to God; thou art not ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd as <hi>tertius a Jove.</hi> Oh Reverence thy ſelf more, and think thy ſelf too good for the moſt faſhionable or creditable ſin. Should <hi>ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one as thou ſin? (Neh.</hi> 6.11.) Should any whoſe Souls are Spiritual
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:42587:302" rendition="simple:additions"/> in their Original, be ſenſual in their Converſation? Far be it from you; But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſe <hi>your Souls well, if they be ſo excellent,</hi> do not ſet them upon trifles. A meaner Soul than ours would ſerve to do thoſe Offices we put our Souls upon, <hi>viz.</hi> to eat, and drink, and ſleep. A Kings Son ſent to a Philoſopher his Governour to know whether he might not take ſuch paſtimes as other Young men did, he only returned for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that he ſhould remember that he was a King's Son. Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who it is you call the <hi>Father of your Spirits,</hi> and pick not ſtraws (you may eaſily know what I mean) with thoſe very Souls which are given thee for higher and better purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Remember that known Maxime, <hi>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima.</hi> A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, filthy or ſinful Soul is worſe than any <hi>Body</hi> can be. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Soul is ſo much worſe than a blind, or lame body, or ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; as the Soul otherwiſe is in its ſelf better than the Body.</p>
               <p>We cannot uſe our Souls well, unleſs we give them <hi>their due ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over our Paſſions and Affections;</hi> and indeed over all the things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Body; God did make theſe Souls for to rule in man, and he ſet up our Underſtanding in the Throne, and commanded our other faculties to obey it, as his Vice-Roy, and Deputy. When men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ther Humours or Luſts, they make their vile <hi>Bodies</hi> to Lord it over theſe precious Souls, and imploy their Souls as purveyors, nay, as drudges for the Body. The Servant rides on Horſeback, and the Prince goes on foot; nay there is a greater diſparity where the Soul is made to truckle to the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, And above all, have a care that <hi>ye do not loſe theſe Souls that are ſo valuable.</hi> I have ſhewn you how that they may be loſt; let me now leave ſome conſiderations to be enlarged upon by you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The danger your <hi>Souls are in, is very great. The Philiſtines are</hi> upon thee; thou doſt not only run a hazard, and it may be, or may not be, but unleſs thou doeſt mightily, and in time (even to day, whilſt it is called to day) beſtirr thy ſelf, thy Soul is certainly, and may be inevitably loſt. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jonathan</hi> in another caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, <hi>As the Lord liveth, there is but a ſtep between thee and Death:</hi> 1 Sam. 20.3. So there is but a ſtep between thy Soul and Death: Nay, your Souls are dead in <hi>treſpaſſes and ſins, (Luk.</hi> 19.10.) they are loſt, but God hath ſent his Son to ſeek, and to ſave.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The loſs of <hi>your Souls is very great.</hi> It is much to loſe an Eſtate, or Wife or Child, but if thou loſeſt thy Soul, thou doſt not loſe only much, but thou loſeſt all. For the whole World cannot now profit thee, and though the clatter and noiſe that worldly things make about our Ears will not ſuffer us to hear or mind this, yet dare but to be alone, converſe with thy ſelf, ask thy Heart and Conſcience, and it will tell thee as much; eſpecially when thou art in affliction, or on a ſick bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The loſs of thy Soul is never to be repaired.</hi> Men may meet with loſſes, which yet they may otherwiſe recover, or may have ſomething
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:42587:303" rendition="simple:additions"/> elſe that may countervail them, but not only nothing can countervail this loſs, (no more than droſs and dung can Jewels of the greateſt price:) but if thou doeſt once loſe thy Soul, nothing can retrieve, or regain it; in this caſe <hi>non licet bis peccare.</hi> If thou once loſeſt thy Soul in this life, there is no means hereafter whereby thou mayeſt recover it, but as the tree falls, ſo it lyeth. Thou that readeſt this, upon this moment (for ought either you or I know) depends thy Eternity: <hi>nunquid aut alter Chriſtus an idem iterum crucifigi habet pro anima,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> asks the queſtion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> Epiſt. 54.</note> is there ſays he another Chriſt? Or do you think that he will be crucifyed again for thy Soul?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Shall I add, that this Soul is thine own, and thou haſt not, nor never ſhalt have another, and therefore it ſtands thee upon to keep it ſafe. The Text calls our Souls <hi>ours, his own Soul,</hi> what ſhall a man be profited, if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe <hi>his own Soul.</hi> Chriſt does not call the World, or any thing in it <hi>ours,</hi> but he calls our Souls <hi>ours;</hi> and certainly they are ours ſo as nothing elſe is, for we muſt forego all other things, and be parted from them; and have been, and may be without them; but without our Souls we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, nor cannot be.</p>
               <p>And 'tis thy <hi>only</hi> Soul, thou haſt to make thy <hi>darling,</hi> and <hi>to be fond and careful of.</hi> Moſt of other things we have double of, as two Eyes, two Hands, and Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God hath given thee but one Soul. <hi>Omnia Deus dedit duplicia animam vero unam.</hi> If thou loſeſt one of the members of thy Body, the other in a great meaſure ſerves in its ſtead, but thy ſoul muſt needs be more carefully looked to, than thy right eye, or thy right hand, for nothing to be ſure can ſtand in ſtead of it, if it be once loſt. Oh remember this is <hi>the one thing neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt anſwer for the loſs of your Souls, God hath entruſted them with you. A great truſt, a great charge, we muſt account for this Talent when our Lord comes. <hi>David</hi>'s Brethren asked him with whom <hi>he had left their Sheep:</hi> God will ask every one of you, with whom ye did leave your Souls? Are not your Children, nay, are not your Goods, (many a man's Swine) more cared for, and look'd after than your Souls?</p>

He that does not earneſtly endeavour to keep his Soul whilſt he lives, the evil Angels when he dyes ſhall require it of him, as you know the Soul of the Covetous wretch was adjudged to them. How unconcernedly do we read or hear of ſuch things? But <hi>mutato nomine de te,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>OUR Apoſtle, in the cloſe of the preceding <hi>Verſe,</hi> had made uſe of a very powerful Motive to excite theſe <hi>Romans,</hi> (and in them all others,) unto <hi>Mortification; [if ye, through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.]</hi> In this <hi>Verſe,</hi> he backs that <hi>Motive</hi> with an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to<note n="†" place="margin">Probatio eſt ejus quod proximè praeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. <hi>Calv.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat quod dixit, vivetis. <hi>Eſth.</hi>

            <p>Under the Firſt, I ſhall commend the following Particulars to you.<note place="margin">Diſtinctions premis'd about the Spirits Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Leading</hi> of the Spirit, is either <hi>General and Common,</hi> or <hi>Peculiar and Special.</hi> If we conſider him <hi>as God,</hi> (in his <hi>joint participation</hi> of the Deity with the Father and the Son, and in his <hi>joint Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with them according to their Divine Eſſence;) ſo, there is a <hi>Leading</hi> by him which does extend to <hi>all Creatures</hi> whatſoever. For all of them, by his Divine Power and Influxe, in their ſeveral Beings, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Motions and Tendencies, are diſpoſed, ordered, governed, and overrul'd to the Glory of the Creator, and the good of the Univerſe. Take them in all their <hi>Faculties,</hi> and in all their <hi>Operations,</hi> they are all <hi>excited, directed, actuated,</hi> by this Spirit. And ſo, (in a general Sence,) they <hi>all</hi> come under his <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Regency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo, may be ſaid to extend to <hi>all men;</hi> to the Unregenerate, as well as to the Regenerate. How? why as they all doe <hi>act</hi> and <hi>move</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> in and by him; as He, in a Common and Providential way, does order and regulate all their ſeveral Actions and Motions; (For this he does in all, as he is the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> and the <hi>ſupream Soveraign.</hi>) So that as there is his common <hi>Illumination,</hi> common <hi>Conviction,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Reſtraints,</hi> common <hi>Gifts,</hi> (which even the Graceleſs partake of;) ſo there is too a common <hi>Leading</hi> by Him which they alſo have.</p>
            <p>Now moſt certainly, this is not <hi>that Leading</hi> which the Text ſpeaks of; for this cannot be the <hi>Foundation</hi> or <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Priviledge mention'd. <hi>A common Act will never entitle to a ſpecial Relation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ductus ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus quo Filij Dei aguntur, non eſt Generalis Dei Actus, quo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia moventur; ſed eſt ſpecialis Gratia, quâ Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii Dei Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur, in viâ ſalutis diriguntur ad Deum. <hi>Pareus.</hi> Obſervare convenit eſſe multiplicem Spiritus Actionem.

            </p>

The <hi>ſpecial Leading</hi> of the Spirit, is <hi>Extraordinary</hi> or <hi>Ordinary.</hi> The <hi>former,</hi> was confin'd to <hi>ſome Perſons,</hi> and to <hi>ſome Times,</hi> and was not to extend to <hi>all Saints,</hi> nor to continue in <hi>all Ages:</hi> Thus the Holy Prophets, the Apoſtles were <hi>led by the Spirit;</hi> as they were <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpir'd, guided,</hi> and <hi>moved</hi> by Him, in the diſcharge of their

               <hi>moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. (and hereupon they were infallible in what they reveal'd.) But this was <hi>extraordinary;</hi> and ſo <hi>Limited and Temporary.</hi> The <hi>latter Leading of the Spirit</hi> therefore muſt be that which is here ſpoken of; that, which appertains to <hi>all Gods Children,</hi> and <hi>at all times.</hi> Did the Apoſtle, when he ſays, <hi>[As many as are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God,]</hi> mean, that as many as have <hi>Extraordinary Viſions, Revelations, Inſpirations, Impulſes,</hi> from the Spirit of God, are thus related to God, and none Other? ſurely no! Should we carry it thus high, we ſhould exclude all but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> from being <hi>Gods Children;</hi> (which would be both ſad, and alſo falſe.) Wherefore 'tis unqueſtionable, that the <hi>Ordinary, Abiding,</hi> and <hi>Permanent Leading</hi> of the Spirit, and that which reaches to <hi>all Believers;</hi> is here intended.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This <hi>Act</hi> of the Spirit may be conſider'd, <hi>either as 'tis exerted at the firſt Converſion, or after.</hi> For as we diſtinguiſh the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, into <hi>Prevenient</hi> and <hi>Subſequent;</hi> ſo we may alſo diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit.</hi> He leads at, and in order to, the <hi>firſt Converſion;</hi> as he then does irradiate the Mind, incline the Will, ſpiritualize the Affections; (and ſo, lead or guide the <hi>whole Soul</hi> to God, and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>) Then he leads <hi>after Converſion;</hi> as this is done by him all along in the <hi>whole courſe</hi> of a Chriſtians Life; (for it is a <hi>continued Act.</hi>) The Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the <hi>Sp rit</hi> to bring a man <hi>into the ſtate of Grace,</hi> that's done but <hi>once;</hi> but the Guidance of the Spirit, <hi>in the ſtate of Grace,</hi> that's done <hi>Daily</hi> and <hi>Renewedly.</hi> The firſt, imports the infuſing of a <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Vital Principle</hi> into the Soul; the latter, <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> this Principle, and makes <hi>uſe of it,</hi> in the Conduct of a Child of God in the way of Holineſs. <hi>Both</hi> are here to be taken in; (yet I conceive,) the laſt may be moſt proper. And Obſerve, theſe two Leadings of the Spirit have a <hi>different reſpect</hi> to our <hi>Sonſhip with God;</hi> For the former <hi>Conſtitutes</hi> it, the latter only <hi>Diſcovers</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> it: The Spirit, as <hi>leading me to God at</hi> the <hi>firſt Converſion, makes</hi> me a Child of God; the Spirit, as <hi>leading me after Converſion,</hi> cauſes it to <hi>appear</hi> that I am a Child of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is the <hi>Having of the Spirit,</hi> and there is the <hi>Leading of the Spirit.</hi> We have both in this Chapter; the One, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>[if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;]</hi> the other, in the <hi>Text.</hi> Now, although theſe <hi>two</hi> be <hi>conjunct</hi> and <hi>inſeparable,</hi> (whoever <hi>have the Spirit,</hi> they are <hi>led by the Spirit);</hi> yet they are <hi>diſtinct</hi> things. To <hi>have the Spirit,</hi> is to be made a <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of Him in his <hi>Indwelling</hi> in us: To be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> is our partaking of his <hi>Directive Influence</hi> after we are made Poſſeſſors of him. The Firſt, ſuppoſes the <hi>receiving</hi> of the <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Principle;</hi> the ſecond, imports the <hi>Operation</hi> from that Agent or Principle.</p>

               <note place="margin">The matter of it.</note>1. <hi>The Matter, what the Spirit leads unto.</hi> This is of great Extent; but all may be reduc'd to theſe two things, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> Truth is ſeated in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and ſpeaks the Spirits <hi>Leading</hi> of that Faculty: Holineſs reaches to the <hi>Heart within,</hi> and <hi>Converſation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;</hi> and ſpeaks the Spirits <hi>Leading</hi> of <hi>Both</hi> (in their utmoſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiveneſs.) Theſe, he <hi>leads</hi> and guides unto; but not in the leaſt to their Oppoſites, <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi> Every Agent is for that which comports and ſuits with his own Nature, and againſt that which is contrary thereunto: Therefore, the Spirit being a <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> and <hi>of Holineſs,</hi> this determines him to <hi>lead</hi> to theſe; and to theſe only. So his Conduct is ſtated in Holy Writ; <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>When he the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth.</hi> Eph. 5.9. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit, is in all goodneſs and righteouſneſs, and Truth.</hi> Pſal. 23.3. <hi>He leadeth me in the paths of righteouſneſs for his Names ſake.</hi> This Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs includes in it <hi>Holy Affections,</hi> the <hi>Exerciſe of the ſeveral Graces,</hi> and theſe the Spirit guides unto: 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Chriſt.

He's a <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> Spirit in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore all his Motions tend to what is Good and Holy. As Satan, he being the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi> ſuitably to his Nature does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and urge to what is <hi>Evil; (Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>John</hi> 13.2.)

<pb n="947" facs="tcp:42587:308" rendition="simple:additions"/> is Good; and to nothing elſe. How do they blaſpheme this Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who do wicked things, and yet preſume to ſay, the Spirit leads them thereunto! This muſt be laid down as a Principle (of undoubted verity,) that the ſole and whole tendency of the Spirits <hi>Leading</hi> is to <hi>Purity, Obedience,</hi> Univerſal <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and in no caſe to ſin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Rule by which he leads.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Rule of it.</note> And that (in ſhort) is the <hi>Written VVord.</hi> God guides by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Spirit guides by the <hi>VVord.</hi> He is <hi>our Guide,</hi> and the Word is <hi>our Rule.</hi> The Spirit himſelf, as to his <hi>own Actings,</hi> has no <hi>External Rule</hi>) to act by; (His <hi>Internal Holineſs</hi> and Perfection being his <hi>ſole Rule.</hi> But as to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> in <hi>our Actings,</hi> we have an <hi>External Rule,</hi> by which all that we do is to be ſquared: and therefore by, and according to this Rule, the Spirit guides us. And our Conformity thereunto, is both the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of the Spirit in his Guidance of us.</p>
            <p>The Word it ſelf, carries in it a leading and directive Property: Prov. 6.22, 23. <hi>VVhen thou goeſt, it ſhall lead thee—For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is a Lamp, and the Law is light:</hi> Pſal. 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path:</hi> 133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy VVord:</hi> Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewn thee O man, what is good</hi> — The <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Revelation</hi> of God's Will is the Chriſtians great <hi>Rule;</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by which in all things he muſt ſteer his Courſe, the Star that muſt direct him in all his Motions: 'Tis to <hi>the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8.20.</note> 
               <hi>and to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys,</hi> that we muſt have our continual Recourſe for the regulating of us in all matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> Now <hi>this Leading</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> are never to be ſever'd: As that is in <hi>ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to This, ſo This is ever in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with That.</p>
            <p>This Word we muſt in all things keep cloſe unto, or elſe we run our ſelves upon moſt dangerous Rocks. The <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> is for a <hi>Light within,</hi> for immediate <hi>Revelations, Inſpirations, Impulſes</hi> from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; (and I know not what:) But are theſe <hi>Praeter-Scriptural?</hi> much more are they <hi>Anti-Scriptural?</hi> Oh then they are nothing but mens own <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Deluſions,</hi> and not at all the <hi>leadings</hi> of the Spirit of God. When any, upon the pretence of <hi>theſe,</hi> go off from the <hi>written Word,</hi> what wild Opinions and Practices do they run themſelves upon! (Of which we have had too many inſtances both at Home and Abroad.) The <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>VVord</hi> are our <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat guide:</hi> The Spirit, gives <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to the Word; and the VVord gives Evidence that the Guidance is from the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But it may be ask'd, <hi>Does the Spirit guide only in this mediate way?</hi>

<pb n="948" facs="tcp:42587:309" rendition="simple:additions"/> Word, evermore is in the <hi>matter,</hi> though ſometimes it may not be in the <hi>manner</hi> of the Spirits Guidance. He may, without making uſe of the Word, by an <hi>immediate Divine Light and Excitation,</hi> lead me to this or that duty; but he never leads me to any thing but what the Word firſt makes to be Duty. Take it in that other <hi>Act</hi> of the Spirit (which follows here, <hi>v.</hi> 16.) <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi> This <hi>witneſſing</hi> of Adoption is uſually <hi>Mediate,</hi> and <hi>by the Word;</hi> yet 'tis not always ſo, ſometimes 'tis <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>without the VVord.</hi> That is, the Spirit aſſures of this, not only in a <hi>ſyllogiſtical</hi> way, by ſuch and ſuch <hi>Scripture-ſigns, Marks, Qualifications, Diſpoſitions,</hi> which evidence Sonſhip to God: (as <hi>He that is led by the Spirit, is the Son of God; Thou art one who art led by the Spirit;</hi> therefore <hi>thou art the Son of God:</hi>) But he ſometimes may, and does, <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> ſay to a perſon, <hi>Thou art a Child of God:</hi> But now, though here he thus witneſſes, <hi>Abſtractly</hi> and <hi>praeciſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> without making uſe of the marks and ſigns of the Word concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Relation; yet, he never <hi>ſo witneſſes,</hi> but <hi>according to the Word,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>where thoſe marks and ſigns are.</hi> In like manner 'tis as to his <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi> this, is not always managed by an <hi>expreſs Revival</hi> upon the Heart of this, or that paſſage in the Word; yet, for the <hi>matter</hi> of it, 'tis ever done in a way, conſonant and agreeable to the Word.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as we keep to this, I think there will be no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or <hi>Fanaticiſme,</hi> (rightly ſo called.)</p>

            <p n="3">3. In regard of <hi>the Degree and Meaſure of it.</hi> Concerning which 'tis clear, that this <hi>Leading</hi> of the Spirit (in the <hi>Directing, Inclining, Governing</hi> Notions of it,) is not as to <hi>Degree</hi> equal in all God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. All have the <hi>Thing</hi> in the <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi> part of it; yet, ſo as that there is a <hi>Gradual Difference</hi> in their having of it; (Some having more, and ſome leſs.)

For although we ſhould grant, (which I do not,) that the Spirit ſhould <hi>advance</hi> his <hi>Guidance,</hi> (conſider'd in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and as it comes <hi>from Him,</hi>) to ſuch a <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Pitch,</hi> as to lay the Foundation of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in Saints here below; yet conſidering, what the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> of this <hi>Act</hi> is here, (they being <hi>Fleſh</hi> as well as <hi>Spirit;</hi>) 'tis not imaginable that <hi>de Facto</hi> and <hi>in Eventu,</hi> they ſhould ever here be <hi>perfect</hi> upon it. Wherefore it muſt be <hi>bounded</hi> and limited, though not from what the Spirit <hi>could do,</hi> yet from what he is <hi>pleaſed to do</hi> in Believers in their preſent imperfect ſtate. <hi>He ſhall guide you into [all Truth;]</hi> what, ſo as to make Saints <hi>Omniſcient</hi> or <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> He guides unto <hi>all Holineſs,</hi> what, ſo as to render them <hi>ſinleſs</hi> and <hi>impeccable</hi> here on Earth? we muſt by no means carry it thus high! It therefore muſt be qualified thus; He ſhall guide you into <hi>all Truth, (i. e.)</hi> into the Knowledge of all <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths:</hi> And he ſhall guide you into <hi>all Holineſs, i. e.</hi>

            <p>And (by the way) Obſerve, that this <hi>Guidance</hi> of the Spirit in the <hi>General,</hi> and that <hi>Guidance</hi> of His in <hi>Particular,</hi> (in the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi>) do much ſtand upon the ſame level. Inſomuch, that as the <hi>Former,</hi> (the Spirits <hi>immediate Guiding</hi> of Believers in the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of their Actions,) does not thereupon render <hi>Them</hi> or <hi>Their Actions</hi> perfectly Holy and free from <hi>all mixtures of ſin:</hi> So neither does the <hi>Latter,</hi> (the Spirits <hi>immediate Guidance</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of Prayer,) render the Prayers of ſuch <hi>infallible,</hi> or of <hi>equal Authority with the Scriptures;</hi> (as ſome Object.) Becauſe as to <hi>Both,</hi> this <hi>Agency</hi> of the Spirit is to be <hi>limited,</hi> partly from the Conſideration of the <hi>preſent State</hi> of the ſubject in whom it is exerted; and partly, from the Spirits <hi>Aim</hi> and <hi>End</hi> therein. 'Tis true, (to obviate a bad Inference that may be drawn from hence,) the Apoſtles themſelves conſidered as <hi>but Men,</hi> and as men in the State of <hi>Imperfection,</hi> ſo they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as we are.

            <p>And thus I have gone over the <hi>Doctrinal Explication</hi> of the <hi>Leading of the Spirit.</hi> I come now to reſolve ſome <hi>Practical Enquiries</hi> about it; (which will be in ſtead of the <hi>Application.</hi>)</p>

            <p>It highly concerns us to be very inquiſitive about this.

And then there's the Grand <hi>Evil Spirit without,</hi> the Devil; <hi>the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. And Oh what an Heart-piercing, Soul-afflicting thing is it to conſider, how the Generality of Men are led by this wicked Spirit! All theſe Spirits are <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Oppoſition to which, there are <hi>Other Spirits</hi> that are <hi>Good.</hi> And they are either the <hi>Renewed Spirit</hi> in Gods people; (the Heart <hi>as ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,</hi> as having a Vital, Supernatural Principle infus'd into it, which leads and inclines to Holineſs:) Or the <hi>Renewing Spirit,</hi> Gods own Spirit; (of whom the Text ſpeaks.)</p>
            <p>Theſe Spirits are contrary to the Former, both in <hi>Themſelves,</hi> and alſo in their <hi>Leadings.</hi> For as They are all for what is <hi>Evil,</hi> ſo Theſe are all for what is <hi>Good.</hi> And the Contrariety is ſuch betwixt them, as that they are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Leading of Gods Spirit,</hi> the Enquiry muſt be confin'd to that: And ſo its laid down, <hi>How may we know whether we be led by the Spirit of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of which, I muſt refer you to what I have been upon. Having ſaid ſo much in the Opening of the <hi>Thing it ſelf,</hi> by the comparing of <hi>your ſelves</hi> with that, you will be able to determine your own Caſe; <hi>whether it belong to you or not?</hi> It would be ſuperfluous for me to enlarge again upon thoſe Heads in the <hi>Application,</hi> which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſo large upon in the <hi>Explication.</hi> Only therefore, (to give ſome brief Direction,) I would deſire you to look back.</p>

Now do you not dread the thoughts of being <hi>led by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi> Oh it will be ſo, unleſs you <hi>be led by this Holy Spirit</hi> of God. What the Devil thy <hi>Leader?</hi> Oh dreadful! What comes after a Devil-<hi>leading,</hi> but a Devil-<hi>tormenting!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Weigh the Way and Manner of the Spirits leading.</hi> You ſee, how the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Oppoſite Leaders</hi> is ſtated; well how does <hi>this Leader</hi> manage his Conduct? with great <hi>exactneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> he ſo <hi>leads,</hi> as never to <hi>miſlead;</hi> ſo as always to direct with the <hi>deepeſt Judgment;</hi> (For, as in all his <hi>Other</hi> Acts, ſo in <hi>This,</hi> he is the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel, the Spirit of Knowledge</hi> — Iſa. 11.2. <hi>I will inſtruct thee</hi> (ſays God,) <hi>and teach thee in the way which thou ſhalt go; I will guide thee [with mine eye;] (i. e.</hi> with great <hi>care</hi> and <hi>accuracy:</hi>) Pſal. 32.8. Thus the Spirit leads. And He does this, with <hi>infinite Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> alſo; As the <hi>wiſe</hi> man, (perſonating his Father,) ſays, <hi>I have taught thee in the way of wiſdom, I have led thee in right paths; Prov.</hi> 4.11. And as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant, (in the Particular Caſe before him,) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of my Maſter Abraham, which hath led me in the right way—Gen.</hi> 24.48. And as the Pſalmiſt, (with reſpect to Gods Conduct of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs,) <hi>He led them forth by the right way; (Pſal.</hi> 107.7.) Such a Leading is this of the Spirit as to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in their whole courſe; he always leads them in the <hi>right way.</hi> And then, he leads <hi>ſafely;</hi> (in reference both to the <hi>Way,</hi> and to the <hi>End.</hi>) He <hi>led them on ſafely,</hi> Pſal. 78.53. (I do but allude to it:) Here's no <hi>ſuch Leader</hi> as Thoſe the Prophet ſpeaks of; <hi>Iſ.</hi> 9.16. The <hi>Leaders of this people cauſe them to err, they that are led of them are deſtroyed.</hi> Oh who then would not be deſirous to <hi>be led by him?</hi> The skilfulleſt, faithfulleſt, ſafeſt Guide the Traveller pitches upon: O Chriſtian, wilt not thou do the ſame for thy precious and immortal Soul?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Advantages, Benefits, Bleſſings, that attend and reſult from this Leading of the Spirit, are great, and glorious.</hi> As (to inſtance in a Few,) <hi>inward Peace</hi> and <hi>Comfort:</hi> whereever the Spirit is a <hi>Leading Spirit,</hi> there he is (or will be) a <hi>Comforting Spirit.</hi> A <hi>Readineſs to all Dutys of Holineſs;</hi> ſo as to do them ſpontaneouſly, and with Delight: Gal. 5.18. <hi>If ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law; (i. e.</hi> ſo as in your Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to act from a <hi>ſervile Spirit,</hi> and from the meer <hi>External Compulſions

If the Spirit be <hi>thy Leader,</hi> God is thy Father: (And what a Priviledge is this! <hi>John</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.) And then, (as the Conſummation of all,) comes the <hi>Glory and Bleſſedneſs of Heaven,</hi> as the certain portion of ſuch who are <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> Death and Hell are not more ſure upon the leading <hi>of Sin and Satan,</hi> than Life and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are ſure upon the leading <hi>of this Spirit.</hi> God ever <hi>ſaves in Heaven</hi> ſuch whom he <hi>leads on Earth.</hi>

            <p>All being put together, and ſeriouſly weighed, have I not ſaid enough and enough to excite you all, <hi>to attain and cloſe with this Bleſſed Leading of the Spirit of God?</hi> (Much more might have been added by way of <hi>Motive;</hi> but if what has been ſaid, will not prevail, I deſpair of ever prevailing with you.)</p>
            <p>A Third Enquiry follows,</p>

               <hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Enquiry.</note>How may this Leading of the Spirit be attained? What is to be done by us, that we may be thus led by Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In order to this, take the following Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There must be the having of the Spirit, before there can be the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit,</hi> This <hi>Order</hi> is founded in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing; We cannot expect to participate of the <hi>Spirits Operations,</hi> (ſuch as are <hi>ſaving,</hi>) before we participate of the <hi>Spirit Himſelf.</hi> Therefore, pray attend upon the Goſpel, (by which He is convey'd to Sinners;) and then, when you have once received him, he will not be<note n="*" place="margin">Non eſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſanctus otioſus movet Mentes et ducit. <hi>Mel.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Idle,</hi> and <hi>Ineffective,</hi> but an <hi>Operative</hi> and <hi>Leading</hi> Spirit in you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Antecedent, Firſt leading of the Spirit muſt be had; before there can be the having of his Subſequent and Secondary Leading.</hi> That is to ſay, He muſt <hi>Firſt</hi> lead you to God by <hi>Converſion;</hi> firſt bring you into a ſtate of Grace; and then way is made for his <hi>ſubſequent Leading</hi> and <hi>Direction.</hi> When he has been a quickning Spirit, (in the infuſing of a vital Principle into the Soul,) then ſucceeds <hi>this Act</hi> which I am upon. And not till then; for who will attempt to lead a thing that is <hi>dead?</hi> This Method of the Spirit therefore muſt be regarded, and comply'd with. 'Tis firſt <hi>Sanctification,</hi> then <hi>Manuduction,</hi> (in the ſeveral Things contained therein.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be willing to follow the Leading, the Motions of the Spirit.</hi> He gives again and again his <hi>ſecret Guidance to</hi> you; (ſhewing what you are to do, what not:) if this be followed and comply'd with, he'l continue it; if not, he'l withdraw, and leave you to follow the Conduct of your own Inclinations; (a ſore Judgment!) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My people would
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:42587:313" rendition="simple:additions"/> not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me: So I gave them up unto their own Hearts Luſt, and they walked in their own Counſel:</hi> (Oh dreadful Word!) The ſame will the Spirit do, upon our <hi>rejecting</hi> or <hi>reſiſting</hi> of his <hi>Leading.</hi> He may <hi>long ſtrive,</hi> but he will <hi>not always ſtrive;</hi> (Gen. 6.3.) If the perſon led ſhall once begin to ſtruggle with him that leads him, and ſhall refuſe to follow his Guidance; what is then to be done, but to leave him to himſelf? Continued, rooted, allowed <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> to to the Spirit, makes him ſo to caſt off a perſon as to <hi>lead</hi> him no more. His <hi>Initial Workings</hi> in this are to be cloſed with, or he goes no further. That <hi>one Act</hi> in the <hi>Leading</hi> of the Spirit, (<hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Powerful Inclining</hi> of the Heart to comply with what he leads unto;) ſecures all the Reſt. If thou art an <hi>Oppoſer</hi> of the Spirit, he will not be thy <hi>Guide:</hi> Yield to Him, and cloſe with Him, and he will not withhold this Grace from thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let your dependance be upon God and his Spirit, for Guidance and Direction.</hi> Would you have Him to <hi>lead</hi> you? Oh let your Truſt and Relyance be upon him; and ſee that you renounce all confidences in yourſelves. He that thinks he has Wiſdom or Grace enough in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to <hi>order his Converſation aright;</hi> ſhall never find the Spirit to be a <hi>Guide</hi> to him. <hi>The meek will he guide in Judgment, the meek will he teach his way;</hi> Pſal. 25.9. VVhen a man is brought to this meek, humble Frame, then he is in the way of the Spirits Leading. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not to thy own underſtanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> Chriſtian Prudence, Caution, and Circumſpection, is our Duty; but do we lay the ſtreſs of our Confidence upon that? <hi>The ſteps of our ſtrength ſhall be ſtraitned, and our own Counſel ſhall caſt us down;</hi> (as he ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 18.7.) <hi>Mans goings are of the Lord, how can a man then underſtand his own way?</hi> Prov. 20.24. So long as thou thinkeſt, thou canſt go <hi>by thy ſelf,</hi> the Spirit will not take thee by the hand <hi>to lead thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Pray much for this Grace of the Spirit.</hi> It being a free and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act on his part, he will be ſought to for it; and give it forth in that way which beſt ſuits with his Soveraignty.<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.5. Pſal. 5.8. Pſal. 31.3. Pſal. 139.24.

Yea, will you not every day make this your requeſt? <hi>Bleſſed God and Spirit, let me be led by thee this day.</hi> Firſt he works as a <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> (in the Drawing forth of the Souls Deſires after this Mercy,) and then as a <hi>Guiding</hi> and <hi>Leading</hi> Spirit. And the Former is a good Plea for the latter; Pſal. 143.8. <hi>Cauſe me to know the way wherein I ſhould walk, for I lift up my Soul unto thee.</hi> Oh that we might all follow theſe Directions, and then we ſhould have not the Thing only, but a large Meaſure thereof!</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſhould more and more follow the Leadings of the Spirit.</hi> I hope I ſpeak to ſome of you who have Theſe, and live dayly under them; if ſo, what is your Duty? Why, in an <hi>Higher Degree,</hi> to obey, and fall in with them. The Following of them, (as that is <hi>Simply</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> conſidered,) is to be ſuppos'd and granted from your <hi>being led by the Spirit;</hi> (for the Former is neceſſarily included in the Latter:) And therefore, 'tis not This, as conſidered <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> that I am ſo much to preſs upon you, as the <hi>Manner, Degree,</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of it. And, in <hi>this reſpect,</hi> the Beſt ſtand in need of Counſel and Quickning; for who do ſo follow the Spirits Leading as they ought? VVe have an <hi>excellent Guide,</hi> one that leads us with <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> that directs us to nothing but what is <hi>Good,</hi> and Good <hi>for us:</hi> Ah, but here's our ſin and miſery, we do not carry our ſelves as we ought, in ſuch an <hi>Obeying</hi> and <hi>Following</hi> of his Conduct as that requires.</p>
            <p>As to this therefore I would excite you to follow the <hi>Spirits Leading thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) More <hi>Exactly;</hi> So as to act juſt as he would have you act, to move juſt as he would have you move; to keep pace with him ſtep by ſtep in all his Holy Motions. VVhat <hi>Iſrael</hi> did to the <hi>Cloud, [At the Commandment of the Lord they journyed, and at the Commandment of the Lord they pitched; as long as the Cloud abode upon the Tabernacle, they reſted in the Tents: — And when the Cloud was taken up in the Morning, then they journyed; whether it was by day or night that the Cloud was taken up, they journyed: Numb.</hi> 9.18.] that we ſhould do to the Holy Spirit in the exact Ordering of all our Motions by and according to his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. This, ſhould be the <hi>Aim</hi> and <hi>Endeavour</hi> of every one of us, though through weakneſs and infirmity, we cannot <hi>Actually</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> come up to it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Follow the Spirit more fully: God gives this high Character of <hi>Caleb,</hi> that <hi>he followed him fully; Numb.</hi> 14.24 Art thou one that art <hi>led by the Spirit:</hi> Oh follow him <hi>fully!</hi> Whatever <hi>Truth</hi> he would have you believe, let it be believed; Whatever <hi>Duty</hi> he would have you practice; let it be practis'd; whatſoever <hi>Sin</hi> he would have you mortifie, let it be mortifyed. As the Scribe ſaid to Chriſt <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Do this more <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformly</hi> and <hi>Conſtantly:</hi> in being more eaven, Fixt and Steddy, in holy walking.</p>
            <p n="4">4. More <hi>Readily,</hi> and <hi>Freely:</hi> Oh there ſhould be no Demurring, Diſputing, <hi>Conſulting with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> hanging back in the Caſe; but a Willing, Ready, Chearful Complyance with whatever the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <hi>leads</hi> us unto! How well does this comport, as with the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſo with the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of his <hi>Leading!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Follow him, ſo as to make <hi>further Progreſs in the way wherein he guides you;</hi> ſo as continually to be getting nearer and nearer to the End of your Journey.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, Follow him with <hi>ſtronger Reſolution and Purpoſe of Heart:</hi> whatever Difficulties, Diſcouragements, Dangers, you meet with, yet reſolve that nothing ſhall make you <hi>leave your Guid,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Courſe</hi> that he has led you to. (And thus I would perſwade you to riſe higher and higher in your <hi>Following of the Spirit.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be your great and conſtant care and endeavour <hi>to get the Spirits Leading continued to you.</hi> You <hi>have</hi> it, pray <hi>keep</hi> it. Can it be well with a Chriſtian when <hi>This</hi> is <hi>ſuſpended</hi> or <hi>withdrawn</hi> from him? How does he Wanderand <hi>Bewilder</hi> himſelf when the Spirit does not <hi>Guid</hi> Him! How backward is he to good, when the Spirit does not <hi>bend</hi> and <hi>incline</hi> him thereunto! How unable to go when the Spirit does not <hi>uphold</hi> him! What vile Luſts and Paſſions <hi>rule</hi> him, when the Spirit does not put forth his holy and gracious <hi>Government</hi> over him! Oh 'tis of infinite concern to all that belong to God to preſerve and ſecure to themſelves the Spirits <hi>Leading!</hi> Take a good Man without this, and he's like a <hi>Ship</hi> without a <hi>Pilot,</hi> a <hi>Blind</hi> Man without a <hi>Guid,</hi> a poor <hi>Chlid</hi> that has none to <hi>ſuſtain</hi> it, the <hi>rude Multitude</hi> that have none to keep them in any <hi>Order.</hi> What a ſad difference is there in the ſame Perſon, as to what he is when the Spirit <hi>leads</hi> him, and as to what he is when the Spirit <hi>leaves</hi> him! Oh therefore let us always keep him with us! I may allude to that paſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Hobab, Numb.</hi> 10.31. <hi>And he ſaid, leave us not I pray thee; foraſmuch as thou knoweſt howe we are to encamp in the Wilderneſs and thou mayſt be to us in ſtead of Eyes.</hi> So let none of us let the <hi>Spirit depart,</hi> or occaſion his Leaving of <hi>

How diſmal would the ſtate of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs have been, if there they had not had the <hi>Cloud</hi> to guide them! So 'tis in the thing before us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it is! You who have it, may rejoyce, and that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's a clear Evidence, a deciding Argument <hi>of your being the Sons of God.</hi> And what a <hi>Soul-rejoycing</hi> Priviledge is that! <hi>Sons of God?</hi> this aſſures of <hi>dear Affection,</hi> tender <hi>Care,</hi> ſtrong <hi>Protection,</hi> conſtant <hi>Proviſion,</hi> free <hi>Acceſs</hi> to God, ready <hi>Audience</hi> of Prayer, a gracious <hi>Preſence</hi> in every Condition, a favourable <hi>Acceptance</hi> of all Duties, a good <hi>Inheritance</hi> and <hi>Portion;</hi> and what not? All Theſe Bleſſings are yours, if ye be the Sons of God; and ſo you are, if <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> Oh then what a Ground of Comfort is this!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As 'tis a certain Evidence of Sonſhip here, ſo 'tis a certain Pledge of Heaven and Salvation hereafter.</hi> And that, both upon the account of the <hi>Relation</hi> which it inſtates in; (<hi>For if Sons, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Coheirs with Chriſt;</hi> Rom. 8.17.) And alſo upon the account
<pb n="962" facs="tcp:42587:316" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the <hi>Leading it ſelf.</hi> For whereever <hi>that</hi> is, as 'tis in <hi>Order</hi> to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo this Salvation by it ſhall <hi>certainly be obtained.</hi> Never did any periſh that liv'd under the Spirits Guidance and Conduct. <hi>God ever ſaves where the Spirit</hi> leads. All that he guids, come ſafe to the End of their Journey, to their Eternal Reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides the Things which are wrap'd up in <hi>this Leading,</hi> beſides the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of it, (all of which carry in them Ground of the higheſt Joy;) conſider but two things Further about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>Abiding, Permanent, Continuing.</hi> The Spirit does not <hi>lead</hi> and then <hi>leave,</hi> (as ſome Guids do with poor Travellers, deſerting them in the midſt of their Dangers;) no, but he <hi>holds on, repeats</hi> and <hi>lengthens out</hi> this Act to the very laſt. True, this depends upon <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on <hi>our part,</hi> (as ye have heard:) but yet theſe do not make the thing <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain</hi> and lyable to <hi>Interciſion;</hi> becauſe 'tis part of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Leading,</hi> to direct, encline, and overpower to the performance of <hi>thoſe Conditions.</hi> So 'tis ſecur'd, as to the <hi>Continuance</hi> of it to all the Elect of God. Every upright Chriſtian may triumphantly ſay with <hi>David, This God is our God for ever, and ever, he will be our guid even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death;</hi> (Pſal. 48.14.) The Cloud never left <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till it brought them to the land of Promiſe; ſo tis here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is managed and carryed on all along, <hi>with Mixtures of all other Grace: i. e.</hi> with the beſtowing of inward <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> and of <hi>all ſupplys</hi> neceſſary to the believing Soul. 'Tis not a <hi>bare, naked</hi> Leading, but ſuch as is attended with the Conveyance of all <hi>Other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> (According to that encouraging Text, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.10.—<hi>He that hath Mercy on them, ſhall lead them, even by the Springs of water ſhall he guid them</hi>) Is not here,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.</note>

               <hi>
                  <note place="margin">6. Enquiry.</note>Since this Leading of the Holy Spirit is a Special and Diſcriminating Act; what Inferences may be drawn from it, as being ſuch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might inſtance in ſeveral, (if I had not already exceeded the Bounds of a Sermon.) Therefore take but this One; <hi>That 'tis not a thing much to be wonder'd at, that Saints</hi> and <hi>Sinners do ſo much differ, and that Saints and Saints do ſo little differ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Difference 'twixt the two Former, is great; Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Heaven and Hell, do not more differ than they. That which the One <hi>Loves,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> hates; in their <hi>viſible Practices,</hi> there's little but <hi>Sin</hi> in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, there's Holineſs (though imperfect) in the other: The One Curſes, Swears, takes Gods Name in Vain, lives a brutiſh Life, minds not God; the Other fears God, avoids Evil, deſires to order Words, Thoughts, Actions by the Rule of the Word, Prays, Sanctifies the Sabbath, does Good: is not here a <hi>vaſt Difference?</hi> There is indeed! but can it be expected it ſhould be otherwiſe; they being led by Different and Contrary Spirits? Oh upon this no wonder that
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:42587:316" rendition="simple:additions"/> their Actings and Courſes are ſo different! Men will, and muſt Be, and Do according to the Spirit which Guides and Governs them: Therefore the Unregenerate and Wicked being under the Guidance and Power of the Evil Spirit, they will do what ſuits with that Spirit: <hi>e contra,</hi> the Renew'd and Sanctifyed being under the Guidance and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Holy Spirit, they will do what ſuits with that Spirit. And upon this Foundation there muſt be an <hi>Everlaſting Difference</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> betwixt them.</p>
            <p>But then for <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> they do not thus <hi>differ.</hi> As to <hi>leſſer Matters,</hi> there may be too much of <hi>Differences</hi> even amongſt Them; but as to the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> ſo there is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Harmony, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> amongſt them. Some live in <hi>one Age,</hi> ſome in another; ſome in <hi>one Place,</hi> ſome in another: yet there is a bleſſed <hi>Oneneſs</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> amongſt them all. They believe the ſame <hi>Truths,</hi> performe the <hi>ſame Duties,</hi> attend upon the <hi>ſame Worſhip,</hi> walk in the <hi>ſame path of Holineſs,</hi> have and act the <hi>ſame Graces,</hi> groan under the <hi>ſame burdens,</hi> drive on the <hi>ſame Deſigns:</hi> as Face anſwers to Face ſo do they to one another. And whence is this? why from this, they are <hi>all led by one and the ſame Spirit.</hi> Hence it is that they do ſo concurr in all the <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> parts of Religion. <hi>We having the ſame Spirit of Faith</hi>— 2 Cor. 4.13. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (which actuates and animates all that Body;) Eph. 4.4.

            <p>IN this Chapter we have the admirable Prayer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered up to the <hi>Father,</hi> a little before his laſt and greateſt Sufferings. In this Prayer we may obſerve the <hi>deſign</hi> and the <hi>contents</hi> of it. The <hi>deſign</hi> of it is to encourage his Diſciples, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>In the proſecution hereof,

                  <item>1. I ſhall give ſome account of <hi>the ſeverals he prayed for,</hi> And</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, he prays for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Himſelf and the Father, for <hi>Faith</hi> the bond of this Union, for <hi>Holineſs</hi> the effect of it; for <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> that it may continue, and not be diſſolved and interrupted, laſtly for <hi>Glory,</hi> the Conſummation of this Union.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>Faith,</hi> that thoſe may have Faith who did not, or do not yet believe, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>That the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> He prays, that thoſe who were choſen to <hi>Glory</hi> as the end, and ſo to <hi>Faith</hi> as the means, may be brought to believe on Chriſt, as ſent of the Father to be the Mediator, and ſo accept of him as their Prophet, Prieſt and King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He prays for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> the growth and increaſe of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> The word of Truth through the Spirit working with it, and making impreſſions by it on the Heart, is the inſtrument and mean, both to begin Holineſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>James</hi> 1.18. and to promote it where it is begun, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. He praies that the Lord would make his word effectual to cleanſe and ſanctifie them more and more. He would have thoſe who are given to him to be ſanctified, truly ſeparated from Sin, the World, and carnal Self, truly conſecrated and appropriated to himſelf, truly offer'd up and imploy'd for him, as thoſe who are wholly his, and cannot without Sacriledge be converted to other ends and uſes than thoſe that are his.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He prayes for <hi>perſeverance,</hi> that thoſe who are <hi>given him,</hi> may hold out and continue to the end, in Faith, and Holineſs, and Union with Him and the Father; that they may not fall away to unbelief, or profaneneſs, nor be ever ſeparated from him with whom they are once united, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Holy Father, keep through thine own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>keep them</hi> in all dangers, in all aſſaults, in all tryals; ſecure them from Sin, from Satan, from the World, that they may be neither frighted, nor enticed from me. <hi>Through thine own name,</hi> the name of God is that by which he is known, as we are known by our names, all thoſe glorious perfections, whereby he hath made known himſelf unto us, his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sovereignty, Allſufficiency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He would have all the infinite Excellencies and Perfections of God, all by which he is called and known, engaged for the ſecurity of his People, that none of them may fall away, and be loſt. <hi>Keep</hi> them by thy Power, by thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs, Sovereignty, Allſufficiency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or if we take theſe
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:42587:318" rendition="simple:additions"/> words for an argument wherewith he urges this Petition, it is of no leſs force, <hi>Keep</hi> them <hi>for thine own names ſake,</hi> for the honour of thine own name, ſo he engages the honour of God for the ſecurity of his people that none of them may fall away; and that is the greateſt, the ſtrongeſt engagement in the World, and gives the beſt ſecurity that poſſibly can be. The Lord will do more for his own Names ſake, than for all the works of his Hands, than for all that is in Heaven and Earth beſides. His Honour is his Intereſt, ſo that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of God is thereby engaged to ſecure the Eternal concerns of his People. Thoſe men in the World that we are not ſecure of, and can have no confidence in otherwiſe; yet if their Intereſt do engage them for us, we think our ſelves ſo far ſure of them. Intereſt amongſt men is the ſtrongeſt obligement, if they underſtand it, and have but ſo much reſpect to themſelves as to be true to it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Prayer engages the Intereſt of his Father, <hi>his Name,</hi> his Honour, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his People, that they may not fall away, and be loſt; and if we acknowledge him to be God, we cannot in the leaſt ſuſpect, either that he knows not what his Intereſt is, or that he will not be true to it. When it is for his Names ſake, or his Honour to ſecure his people, it ſhall certainly be done, and this is that which Chriſt urges in this Petition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He prays for <hi>Glory, ver.</hi> 22, 24. And <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</hi> It is the Glory of Chriſt that he is the <hi>Son</hi> of God, his <hi>only Son</hi> by Eternal Generation, and <hi>Heir</hi> of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. Now ſuch a Glory will Chriſt have for his people, ſomething like it, though in a way below it; he will have them to be <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of God, <hi>Co-heirs</hi> with himſelf. A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Glory indeed, and ſuch a degree of it as could never have entred into the Heart of man to expect or believe, if the Lord himſelf had not given aſſurance of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>And if Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> All that are given him, he will have to be adorn'd with his own title, and be accounted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and all that are Sons, he will have to be <hi>Heirs,</hi> and <hi>joint-Heirs</hi> with himſelf, not of ſome meaner part of his Fathers poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but even of his Kingdom, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. being <hi>Heirs,</hi> they have <hi>hopes</hi> to inherit, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. They have a <hi>Title</hi> upon this account, and ſo <hi>hope;</hi> but Chriſt not ſatisfyed with this prays al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they may have <hi>poſſeſſion, ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which thou haſt given me;</hi> that they may behold it, ſo as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, this ſight will be the higheſt, the happyeſt enjoyment, it will be an enhappying, a glorifying ſight, a ſight that will make them who behold it happy, perfectly ſo, eternally ſo. The ſight of Chriſts Glory will make them glorious, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Beloved, now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> We
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:42587:319" rendition="simple:additions"/> are <hi>Sons,</hi> that is a great Glory indeed, but there is a Glory to come which is far greater, ſo great, that no expreſſion can fully repreſent it to us, or make it appear to be ſo much, ſo great, as indeed it is, but this is the ſum of it, <hi>we ſhall be like him</hi> in Glory, <hi>for we ſhall ſee</hi> how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he is. The ſight of our Glorious Redeemer, will make us glorious like him. When we are in the ſight of that Glory wherewith he now ſhines <hi>at the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty on high,</hi> (to which the greateſt brightneſs of the Sun is leſs than a ſpark) we ſhall be adorned with his beams, and ſo made glorious. A hint here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have in what is recorded of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who when he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a nearer converſe with God, it is ſaid <hi>his face ſhined, Exod.</hi> 34.29, 35. His face was <hi>horned,</hi> (as the word imports) it appeared in ſuch a form as the raies of the Sun appear to us, his face ſent forth beams like the Sun, there was ſuch a radiant Luſtre, ſuch a Glory in his face, as the weak eyes of mortals could not bear, could not <hi>look</hi> on. When we are where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, and ſee him in the brightneſs of his Glory (which is that he prays for) the ſight of it will transform our Souls <hi>from Glory to Glory,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſion is in reference to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. a Glory will be derived upon our Souls from his Glory, and upon our bodies too; that Glorious Viſion will be a transforming ſight, and <hi>change vile Bodies, ſo that they ſhall be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned like unto his own glorious Body.</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He prays for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> This Union is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, a great depth, ſuch as I was loath to venture on, if it could have been avoided; what my ſhallowneſs can ſay of it briefly, I ſhall comprize in ſome few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an Union of Believers with God, with the Father and the Son, not an Union of Believers among themſelves, at leaſt not this only. For the Union expreſſed in thoſe firſt words <hi>(that they may be one)</hi> is declared or illuſtrated in theſe following, <hi>as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,</hi> and ſo is the ſame Union with that in the laſt words, which is taken to be an Union with the Father and the Son (that they may be one in or with us:) or elſe the words here uſed to illuſtrate one thing, would not illuſtrate that, but another. <hi>That they may be one,</hi> how? <hi>as thou Father art one in me, and I in thee, ſo they may be one in us.</hi> Beſides the ſame words in effect are uſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> and the ſame explained imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>I in them, ver.</hi> 26. <hi>I in them,</hi> by which without queſtion Chriſt both here and elſewhere expreſſes the Union of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with himſelf; though I will not deny that the Union among Believers themſelves may be included, being a conſequent of the other, and that which Unites them with Chriſt, unites them among themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Union hath ſome reſemblance of that between the Father and the Son, <hi>that they may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,</hi>

<pb n="969" facs="tcp:42587:319" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>likeneſs.</hi> That we may know what of reſemblance there is, we muſt inquire, (but very modeſtly, as becomes thoſe who are ſo much in the dark,) how the <hi>Father</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>in the Son, and he in the Father.</hi> For this purpoſe Chriſt may be conſidered, either as <hi>God,</hi> or as <hi>Man.</hi> As <hi>God he is in the Father, and the Father in him,</hi> or which is the ſame, <hi>he is one with the Father,</hi> becauſe they are of one and the ſame Nature and Eſſence, the ſame Infinite Excellencies, and Eſſential Perfections that are in the Father, are alſo in the Son; upon this account <hi>the Son is ſaid to be in the Father, and the Father in him,</hi> Joh. 14.10, 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, ſo that he that hath ſeen the Son, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>and he that hath known the Son, hath known the Father,</hi> ver. 7. becauſe they are one and the ſame in Nature and Eſſence, the very ſame as to all divine perfections. And thus the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>one,</hi> 1 John 5.7. <hi>For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> one in <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are Eſſential to God, though diſtinct in <hi>perſonality</hi> and <hi>manner of ſubſiſtence.</hi> There is an <hi>Eſſential</hi> Union between the Father and the Son, as he is God; no ſuch Union muſt be imagined between them and Believers, the diſtance is no leſs than infinite, and if there can be any reſemblance, it muſt be very remote.</p>
            <p>If we conſider <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> he may be ſaid to be <hi>one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and is ſo, becauſe the ſame Spirit, which is called the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of the Father, dwells in the Humane Nature of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. And this may help us better to apprehend, how we may be ſaid to be one in or with the Father and the Son. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The moſt intelligible way of expreſſing this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which I meet with, is this, believers are ſaid to be <hi>one with the Father,</hi> becauſe that Spirit which proceeds from him, and is called his Spirit, is <hi>in them.</hi> They are ſaid to be <hi>one with the Son,</hi> not only becauſe that Spirit which proceeds from the <hi>Son,</hi> and is called the Spirit of Chriſt, reſides in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; but becauſe the ſame individual Spirit, which dwels in the Humane Nature of Chriſt, dwels alſo in them, 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord, is one Spirit,</hi> he that is <hi>one</hi> with the Lord, hath <hi>one Spirit</hi> with him, he is quickned and acted by the Spirit of the Lord dwelling in him. They are not one <hi>eſſentially</hi> as the Father and the Son are one, being of one and the ſame Eſſence; nor one <hi>perſonally,</hi> as the Divine and Humane Nature of Chriſt, being united in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; nor one <hi>morally</hi> only; as he whoſe Heart cleaves to another by love, is one with him, but one <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> or <hi>one Spirit,</hi> becauſe one and the ſame Spirit is in both. So elſewhere our Union with God and Chriſt is ſaid to be by the <hi>Spirit in us,</hi> Eph. 2.22. <hi>In whom you alſo are builded together for an habitation of God, through the Spirit,</hi> We are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and God is in us as <hi>his habitation,</hi> as thoſe in whom he dwels, how? <hi>through his Spirit.</hi> By his Spirit <hi>dwelling in us,</hi> as it is expreſſed,
<pb n="970" facs="tcp:42587:320" rendition="simple:additions"/> Rom. 8.9, 10, 11. <hi>But ye are not in the Fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you, now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, and if Chriſt be in you — and if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you,</hi> &amp;c. Ye are Spiritual, if <hi>the Spirit of God dwell in you, but if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> none of his Members, not united to him, <hi>but if Chriſt be in you,</hi> (as is before ſignifyed,) <hi>by the Spirit of God dwelling in you,</hi> &amp;c. So that this Union by the Apoſtles account, conſiſts in the <hi>Spirits dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us,</hi> and it will be farther cleared by ſhewing how the <hi>Spirit dwels in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Holy Spirit, by virtue of whoſe inhabitation Believers are ſaid to be united unto the Father and the Son dwells in them as a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Spiritual Life and Motion,</hi> quickens them to a new Life, and all the acts of it. There are ſome who will not have the <hi>perſon</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be in the Saints, but I know not how this can be denyed, without denying either the <hi>immenſity</hi> or <hi>perſonality</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit. For if he be a <hi>perſon,</hi> and if he be <hi>every where,</hi> his perſon will be preſent, and reſide in them. It is true upon this account meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing ſingular is aſcribed to them, for his perſon is not with them only, but every where. The peculiarity of this priviledge lies here, that he is in them as <hi>a principle of ſpiritual Life and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (and thus he is not in any other Creature on Earth) he quickens and acts them as a vital Principle, like as an Humane Soul united unto the Body, gives it Life and Motion ſuitable to its Nature; ſo does the Spirit of God, taking poſſeſſion of the Soul of a Believer, enliven and act it with the Life and Motions of a Divine and Spiritual Nature. Not that the Spirit is united to the Soul, as the Soul is with the Body; for theſe united make one perſon, whereas the perſonali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit is incommunicable; but that, the Holy Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms ſuch Offices in a believing Soul, as have ſome reſemblance, and are ſome way correſpondent to what the Soul does in and for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and which the Scripture expreſſes in like terms, and this we find frequently, the Spirit is ſaid to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>act</hi> thoſe in whom he dwells, they have new life and motion by his inhabitation, Rom. 8.11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> The Apoſtle having ſignify'd in the former verſes, that our Union with God and Chriſt is by the Spirits dwelling in us, he expreſſes what may be expected from this <hi>inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Chriſt's Spirit <hi>dwelling in us will quicken our mortal bodies,</hi> will be a principle of Life in them, quickning them to a new Life, a Life of Holineſs. The ſame Spirit, as he <hi>quickens,</hi> ſo he <hi>acts</hi> thoſe in whom he dwells, who are therefore ſaid to be <hi>led by him,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God they are the ſons of God,</hi> they are excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, directed, enabled to act like the Children of God by his Spirit dwelling in them: ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. And <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do
<pb n="971" facs="tcp:42587:320" rendition="simple:additions"/> them;</hi> the Spirit which I will put within you, ſhall make you active in my wayes. So much for the firſt Propoſal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>What encouragement have we from Chriſts Prayer, that this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>and the Bleſſings relating thereto ſhall be vouchſafed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our encouragement in general is the full aſſurance given us that his Prayer is prevalent for what he deſired; the particular grounds of this aſſurance, are more particular encouragements. There are ſeveral things requiſite to a Prayer, which when they concurr, the Word of God aſſures us that it will prevail.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When the things deſired are according to the Will of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) When the Perſon praying hath a ſpecial Intereſt in God, and duly improves it. There are ſome whom the Scripture declares God will not hear, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When the perſons prayed for are ſuch as the Lord hath ſome particular favour, or reſpect for. There are ſome for whom the Lord will not hear the beſt of his Servants interceding on their behalf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16.—11.14.—14.11. Now in the Prayer of Chriſt there is a concurrence, and that in a tranſcendent manner, of all thoſe things that render a Prayer undoubtedly prevalent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The things that he prayed for were conſonant to the Will of God in every inſtance. He knew what was the Fathers Will in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and diſcerned it with the greateſt clearneſs and certainty; for as he is <hi>God,</hi> he is <hi>one with the Father,</hi> of one and the ſame Eſſence and <hi>Will,</hi> and as he is <hi>man,</hi> he had in him <hi>all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> a fulneſs of the Spirit of Revelation, ſo that he did perfectly apprehend what was <hi>the good, and perfect, and acceptable Will of God.</hi> He did not only know this in particular inſtances, by general rules of Scripture, as we do; but had the conduct of an Infallible Spirit, and that alwaies; not ſometimes only, and in ſome things, as holy men of God, the Prophets and Apoſtles had it; but in every Act and Word. And as he perfectly and infallibly underſtood what was agreeable to the Will of God in all points, ſo he gave himſelf up intirely to the moſt exact obſervance of it, without varying, without the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of miſtake or deviation: This was the end why he came into the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38. This was his conſtant practice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.30. in his Sufferings, and Actings, and in his Prayers; this was his delight, Joh. 4.34. Now ſince he preſented nothing in his Petitions, but what was his Fathers own Will, deſired nothing but it was his Fathers Will to grant, we may be as certain that his Prayer was granted, as we are ſure that the Lord will comply with his own Will.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Second,</hi> It will be apparent by ſhewing who it was that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how he prayed, of which take an account in ſome particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="972" facs="tcp:42587:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. This was the Prayer of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was <hi>Holy, Harmleſs, and ſeparate from Sinners;</hi> he was a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh, and ſo was this Offering, the pure Eye of God could ſee no blemiſh in him or it. His requeſts were not prejudiced by any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent guilt, nor tainted with any impure mixture, either apparent or ſecret, nor chargeable with the leaſt defect in Fervour, Faith, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onateneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was a ſinleſs Prayer in all reſpects, and ſo, ſuch a Prayer as was never offered to God on Earth, ſince the Foundation of the World, and Sins entring into it. It was not liable to the leaſt exception, no not at the Tribunal of ſtrict Juſtice, and ſo could not but be acceptable and prevalent.</p>
            <p>Nay, it was not only clear from every the leaſt ſpeck of ſin, but was the product of admirable Holineſs, ſuch as is not to be found in the Holyeſt Soul or Spirit, Saint, or Angel. He had it in larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in an higher degree, and in a more excellent way. Some tell us that if all the Holineſs that is in all the Angels and Saints were united in one ſubject, it would fall ſhort of that which is in <hi>Chriſts Humane Nature.</hi> However it is taken for granted, that the capacity of his Soul was wonderfully enlarged, by its <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, far beyond the capacity of any other finite-Being; and all this capacity was wholly filled with Holineſs, <hi>it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> and God <hi>gave not the Spirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> Joh. 3.34. Saints and Angels receive it as Veſſels of ſmall meaſure, but in <hi>Chriſt</hi> it is unmeaſurable. Now all this Holineſs was exerted in this Prayer, and diffuſed through it. Grace in him was not acted ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely, ſometimes more remiſly, (for remiſneſs ſeems to import ſome culpable effect) but was put forth on proper occaſions, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Prayer, in its full power and vigour. Upon this account this Prayer was the <hi>Holyeſt Offering</hi> that ever was preſented to the moſt <hi>Holy God,</hi> either on Earth, or in Heaven, and therefore could not but be moſt acceptable to him, and accordingly prevalent and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the Prayer of him <hi>who is God,</hi> of him who is God and Man in one perſon. As the Blood of Chriſt is ſaid to be the blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. by the ſame reaſon, the Prayer of Chriſt may be ſaid to be the Prayer of God. And though it be properly the Act of Chriſt's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, yet this Nature being perſonally united with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it is upon that ground duly aſcribed to the Divine Nature and Perſon of Chriſt; which being infinite an anſwerable value and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is derived upon this Prayer. So that though it be but finite <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> as it is the proper Act of a finite Being, yet it is of infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and value <hi>relatively,</hi> and ſo far of infinite efficacy. Let us ſuppoſe, that all the Angels and Saints in Heaven and Earth, ſhould agree to proſtrate themſelves before God, and joyn together in one Prayer for us, and that influenced with all the Holineſs, inforced with all the fervour and importunity, that thoſe Heavenly Spirits and Holy
<pb n="973" facs="tcp:42587:321" rendition="simple:additions"/> Souls are capable of; we would conclude ſuch a Prayer would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly prevalent: and yet we may believe upon unqueſtionable grounds, that this one Prayer of our Bleſſed Redeemer is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yea, infinitely more prevalent and effectual. In ſhort, this Prayer is nothing elſe, but the Will and deſires of him who is God, offered in manner of a Supplication, and there can be no queſtion, but <hi>that Will</hi> and <hi>thoſe Deſires</hi> ſhall be fulfilled to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Prayer was founded on <hi>merit,</hi> He prayed for nothing but what he was worthy to obtain, ſought nothing on our behalf, but what he did purchaſe for us, and deſerve of his Father, He might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Supplication <hi>for his own righteouſneſs</hi> (as the beſt of his people could not, durſt not do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.19.) he might expect to obtain what he asked from the hand of Juſtice; not as we, only from meer bounty and free mercy. Chriſt's obedience unto Death it was meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and did deſerve for his people all that he prayed for. All the ingredients of ſtrict and proper merit concur in the Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, as I might ſhew particularly, but that I haſten, they were of equal worth with the recompence which he prays for in the behalf of his people; he thereby fully ſatisfyed the demands both of Law and Juſtice, and though it was the Life and Pardon and Happineſs of a World of condemned Perſons that he prays for, yet his Obedience and Blood is of more worth than all theſe; for they are of infinite value, being the Obedience and Blood of him who was God. So that Chriſts Obedience, Active and Paſſive is meritorious, not only <hi>ratione pacti,</hi> by reaſon of the agreement betwixt the Father and Him, he having performed all the Conditions required in order to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; but <hi>ratione pretii,</hi> by virtue of the intrinſick value of what he paid and performed. Now, to uſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>to him that thus worketh the reward is reckoned, not of Grace, but of Debt:</hi> It is Grace to us, but 'tis Debt to Chriſt, and ſo the plea on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half being for a juſt Debt, it cannot but be moſt effectual with the righteous God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is the Prayer of him for whoſe ſake all other Prayers were heard. We have direction, if we would have our Prayers not fail of ſucceſs, to preſent them in <hi>the Name of Chriſt, i. e.</hi> to beg what we deſire for his ſake; and he gives aſſurance that what we ſo pray for (in his name or for his ſake) ſhall be granted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. and 15.16. and 14.13, 14. Now if the Prayers of his people will prevail for his ſake, there can be no queſtion but his own Prayer will be prevalent; all our Prayers are accepted through him, upon his account, nor can they be acceptable otherwiſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. There is that corruption in our Natures, which depraves and vitiates our Spiritual Sacrifices, our Prayers particularly; there is more or leſs of a ſinful tincture in them; they cannot be well-pleaſing to that Holy of God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, till they be purged, and the guilt expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="974" facs="tcp:42587:322" rendition="simple:additions"/> nothing is ſufficient for expiation but the great Propitiatory Sacrifice, by virtue whereof this guilt is expiated, and we are ſaid to be <hi>Sanctifyed</hi> in a Sacrificial Senſe, that is, purged from guilt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. Thus himſelf purged our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and thereby, that which was occaſion of Offence to God being removed, our Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acceptable through Jeſus Chriſt, in this ſenſe he ſaith, ver. 19. <hi>and for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo may be ſanctified:</hi> I <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,</hi> that is, I offer my ſelf an expiatory Sacrifice, that they may be truly ſanctifyed, that is, freed from guilt, and ſo render'd well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable. Now the Prayers of others being acceptable through the Mediation of Chriſt, the Prayers of the great Mediator himſelf will undoubtedly be moſt acceptable, moſt prevalent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Perſons prayed for, they are ſuch as on whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is no leſs willing to beſtow what is here deſired than Chriſt was to ſeek them on their behalf. This appears by ſeveral Expreſſions in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They belonged to the Father in a ſpecial manner, <hi>Thine they were,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>and thine they are,</hi> ver. 9. They were his in <hi>deſign</hi> and purpoſe, before the Foundation of the World, choſen Veſſels, ſet apart for him, as his own peculiarly. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And his <hi>Actually,</hi> by Effectual Calling, they reſigning up themſelves unto him, and he taking poſſeſſion of them as his own, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.24, 25. Now to whom is the Lord willing to grant theſe favours, if not to thoſe who are ſo much his own?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe whom he prayes for, are <hi>given</hi> to him, as is many times expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 24. and given to him that he might redeem and ſave them, or as it is expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>that he ſhould give eternal Life unto them:</hi> this comprizes all that he prays for on their behalf, and that is the <hi>end</hi> why they are given him; now the Father is as willing to promote his own <hi>end</hi> and deſign as the Son; and ſo no leſs willing to grant what is deſired in order thereto, than the great Interceſſour was to pray for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe for whom he prays are ſuch as the Father <hi>loves,</hi> with a tranſcendent, a wonderful love, ver. 23. <hi>and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me:</hi> not with the <hi>ſame</hi> love which the Father hath for the Son, nor with a love <hi>equal</hi> to it, but a love ſo great as comes neareſt to it of all others. A greater love than any Creatures, Men or Angels have for them, or for one another; a far greater love than he hath for any other Creatures in this World. A demonſtrative inſtance hereof we have, in that he gave his Son for them, which was the greateſt expreſſion of love that ever the World ſaw or heard of, and greater than could ever have been believed, if truth it ſelf had not declared it; that he ſhould ſend his Son to reſide on Earth, not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, like himſelf, but to take the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> and live as a <hi>man of ſorrows</hi> and ſufferings, and die as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> under the Sin and Curſe of thoſe for whom he was offered, oh what manner of love was this! Now as the Apoſtle argues, Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="975" facs="tcp:42587:322" rendition="simple:additions"/> his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> how can he not be freely willing to give us any thing at his Sons requeſt, when he loved us ſo, as to give the Son himſelf for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Since it is thus, What greater encouragement can we have for our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> than this <hi>Prayer of Chriſt?</hi> What can be a firmer ground of hope, or more effectually raiſe our expectations, of what is here prayed for? that is, of all wherein our happineſs is concerned, for the Prayer doth comprize all that is requiſite to make us happy here, and for ever.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What ſupport is there that <hi>Faith</hi> doth need, or can have, which it may not here meet with? Is it the infinite Mercies and Compaſſions of God? Why, this Prayer not only engages the Mercy and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God; it is a Righteous thing with God to grant the requeſts of Chriſt. Is it the Covenant of Grace, or the great and pretious promiſes? Why, he that here prays is the Mediator of the Covenant, in whom <hi>all the promiſes are Yea, and Amen.</hi> Is it the Humiliation of the Son of God? Why, this is a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtance of his Humiliation, where he who hath Heaven and Earth, and all Creatures at his Command, offers himſelf in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and preſents theſe particulars in the poſture, with the voice, and in the Words of a Supplicant. Is it the Obedience and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt? Why, this was in him a meritorious Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; he prayed as <hi>one made under the Law,</hi> and this was one way whereby he fulfilled the Righteouſneſs of it. Is it the Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt? Why, this is the ground upon which his Prayer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, ver. 19. <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf that they alſo might be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> thoſe for whom I offer theſe requeſts, are no other than thoſe for whom I offer my ſelf a Sacrifice. Is it the interceſſion of Chriſt at the right hand of the Father? Why, his Prayer on Earth, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, differ but <hi>circumſtantially;</hi> and the Circumſtances which make the difference, make no leſs for the ſupport of Faith: he prayed for the ſame Perſons, and for the ſame things too, for which he intercedes, and it is the ſame Perſon that both prayed and intercedes, he is in both the Son of God, and the Son of Man too. The difference is that in his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> his Sacrifice is preſented as <hi>already offered,</hi> in his <hi>Prayer</hi> it was preſented as <hi>ready to be offered;</hi> but it was no leſs effectual before it was actually offered, than after. Beſides he prayed in the ſtate of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, he intercedes in the height of his Glorious Advancement, but his Exaltation in Heaven is the effect of his Prayer on Earth, ver. 5. <hi>Now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was:</hi> in ſhort, his Prayer was his Interceſſion <hi>begun,</hi> and his Interceſſion is the <hi>continuing</hi> of his Prayer; for it hath the Eſſence of a Prayer, being the preſenting of his Will and Deſires to the Father on the behalf of his People. Laſtly is the Word of him
<pb n="976" facs="tcp:42587:323" rendition="simple:additions"/> who is Truth it ſelf a ſupport of Faith? Why, this we have alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Chriſts Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 11.41, 42. <hi>Jeſus lift up his eyes, and ſaid, Father, I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me, and I know that thou heareſt me alwaies.</hi> You ſee what ſupports Faith hath from this Prayer, even all that is requiſite to raiſe it to a full aſſurance, if not all that is poſſible.</p>
            <p n="2">II. What qualifications would you deſire in one that pleads for you, to make you confident that his plea will be ſucceſsful and prevalent? You may find a concurrence of all theſe, and that far more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently than in any, in whom you would have the moſt confidence; For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, He hath <hi>Power,</hi> no leſs than <hi>all: all power is given him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> Matth. 22.18. He hath power to prevail with the Father; and power to order all Creatures in Heaven and Earth into a ſubſerviency to what he deſires. He is <hi>willing,</hi> and earneſtly deſires the happineſs of his People, and all that tends to it; and theſe deſires flow from the wonderful Love of an Infinite God, and the greateſt compaſſions of a perfect man, united in one perſon; and ſo from an affection altogether unparallel'd, ſuch as cannot be found in Heaven or Earth, ſave only in the Lord our Redeemer and Advocate. Farther, he hath <hi>Authority,</hi> he was called to be an High Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by that Office to pray for his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 7. and being faithful in the diſcharge of it, could not but be ſucceſsful therein: his Honour is engaged, and depends both upon the Execution of his Office, and the ſucceſs of it. The Father called him to be an <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and ſo to pray for his People; he would not have called him to it, but with a deſign to comply with him in it, and to be prevailed with by it. Beſides he hath <hi>right,</hi> and pleads for nothing but what he hath right to obtain; pleads for nothing with the Righteous God on our behalf, but what he hath purchaſed with that which is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value. Alſo he hath <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the greateſt imaginable, as much Intereſt as is poſſible; he makes not this addreſs to a Stranger, or a Friend, or a common Relative, but to his Father, one <hi>who loves him as himſelf,</hi> Joh. 5.20. He hath as much Intereſt in him, as in himſelf, and can prevail as much with him, as with himſelf, and can no more be denyed by him in what he deſires, than he can deny himſelf, for <hi>they are both one,</hi> Joh. 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> they have not only one Intereſt and Deſign, but one Eſſence and <hi>Will:</hi> What Chriſt wills, the Father wills; Chriſt directs us to ſay to the Father when we pray, <hi>thy Will be done,</hi> and the Father ſaith to Chriſt praying for us, thy will be done; for it is no other than his own Will; and Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, rather than one jot or tittle of it ſhall not be fulfilled. Laſtly, He had a perſonal, a <hi>particular reſpect,</hi> for every of his Servants in his Prayer. It is as comfortable, and will be as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and gives as much aſſurance of ſucceſs, as if now in Heaven he did pray for every of us by name. The High Prieſt under the Law carried the Names of the Twelve Tribes upon his Breaſt when he
<pb n="977" facs="tcp:42587:323" rendition="simple:additions"/> vent into the Holyeſt, to intercede for the people; he was herein a Type of Chriſt the great High Prieſt, and his People were ſo in his Mind and Heart while he made theſe requeſts, that his Prayer reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every individual, no leſs effectually, than if he had petitioned for each of them by Name. Theſe ſeverals duly conſidered are enough (if any thing in the World be ſo) to advance Faith unto the height of Confidence, that thoſe for whom Chriſt prayed, ſhall obtain all the rich and glorious things which he deſired.</p>
            <p>Finally, Here is the greateſt encouragement for our <hi>Prayers</hi> that can be deſired, for hereby it is manifeſt, that whatever we can beg of God, which is needful for our Happineſs here, or hereafter, it hath been already prayed for on our behalf by <hi>Chriſt Himſelf,</hi> who was not, who could not be denyed. When we pray for our Relatives or others, who are given to Chriſt, but do not yet believe, that they may have Faith. When we pray for Union with the Father and the Son, for the comfort, improvement, and continuance of this Union. When we pray for pardon of ſin, and the purging of guilt by the grand Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Expiation; when we pray for Holineſs, the increaſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it; when we pray to be kept from the evil of the World, (which is all in the World we need to fear) from the evil of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or whatever may be deſtructive to our Souls; in a word, when we pray for Eternal Glory: it is evident by the premiſſes, that all theſe, and what elſe is neceſſary for theſe purpoſes, were on the behalf of thoſe that do, or ſhall believe, the requeſts of the great Mediator, who was God and Man in one Perſon, and could no more be repulſed than God can deny Himſelf, in a Prayer that was not lyable to the leaſt exception from Juſtice or Holineſs it ſelf, that was in all points exactly agreeable unto the Will of God, and infinitely acceptable to the Divine Majeſty; therefore praying for any, or all theſe things expreſſed or included in this Divine Prayer, as we are required, we may be as fully perſwaded that they will not be denyed us, as we may be confident that the requeſts of our great Advocate, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous will be granted.</p>

            <p>ETernal! What a ſound doth this word Eternal make in my Ears? What workings doth it cauſe within my Heart? What caſting about of Thoughts, what word is next to be added to it? Is it, Eternal World? Where? For this is Temporal: Oh! that Eternal World is now by us unſeen, and as to us is yet to come. But yet my trembling Heart is ſtill ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to what other word, this word Eternal might be prefixed as to my ſelf, or thoſe that hear me this day, when they and I (who through the long ſufferance of God are yet in this preſent and temporal) ſhall be in that Eternal World. Shall it be <hi>Eternal damnation</hi> in that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World?</hi> How? after ſo many knockings of Chriſt? Strivings of the Spirit? Tenders of Mercy? Wooings of Grace?

What then? This word <hi>Eternal,</hi> is the horror of Devils, the amazement of damned Souls, which cauſeth deſperation in all that Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Crew, for it woundeth like a Dart, continually ſticking in them, that they moſt certainly know that they are damned to all Eternity. Eternal! it is the Joy of Angels, the Delight of Saints, that while they are made happy in the beatifical Viſion, are filled with perfect Love and Joy, they ſit and ſing, all this will be <hi>Eternal.</hi> Eternal! this word it is a loud alarm to all that be in time, a ſerious caution to make this our grand concern, that when we muſt go out of time, our Eternal Souls might not be doomed down to Eternal Damnation, but might obtain Salvation that ſhall be Eternal, of which we have hope and expectation, <hi>while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen, are Eternal.</hi>

Therefore according to the manner of Beings, muſt be the manner of their Abidings. All Beings may be ranked into three ſorts, whence ariſe three ſorts of Duration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some things have <hi>both beginning and end,</hi> as Beaſts, and other corruptible Creatures, and their duration is time, which hath both beginning and end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some things have <hi>a beginning, and no end;</hi> as Angels, and the Souls of Men, and the ſtate of both in the other World; and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by which theſe are meaſured in Philoſophy to diſtinguiſh it from Time and Eternity ſtrictly taken is called <hi>Aeviternity;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only an Initial defectibility of the things in themſelves, though by the abſolute power of God there might be a period put unto their being once begun, but there is no principle of corruption in their own Nature, which ſhould cauſe a ceſſation of their exiſting Eſſence: nor is it in the verge of any created Power or ſecond Cauſe to take that Being from them, which was given to them by the firſt; and theſe things becauſe they have no end, are Eternal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. One only Being hath <hi>neither beginning nor end,</hi> nor can have; and that is God; and his duration is Eternity, properly and moſt ſtrictly taken, which is <hi>a duration inferring ſimple interminability of Eſſence all at once exiſting without ſucceſſion.</hi> Eternity in the moſt proper accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth exclude not only actual beginning and end, but all <hi>poſſibility</hi> of both, and denotes indefectibility of Eſſence <hi>a parte ante, &amp; a parte poſt,</hi> exiſting all at once in one continued immoveable inſtant, without conſideration of any thing in it paſt or to come, though it alwaies was and will be; plainly to every capacity might this be thus adapted: if you look backwards, you cannot think of any one moment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God was not: if you look forwards, you cannot think of any one moment when God ſhall not be; for if there had been one moment when God was not, no thing could ever have been: neither God nor Creature, unleſs that which is nothing could make it ſelf ſomething, which is impoſſible; becauſe <hi>Working ſuppoſeth Being,</hi> and a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="984" facs="tcp:42587:327" rendition="simple:additions"/> becauſe it infers the Being of a thing before it was; for in order of time or Nature, the Cauſe muſt be before the Effect: Neither can you conceive any one moment beyond which God ſhould ceaſe to be; becauſe you cannot imagine any thing in God, or diſtinct from him, that ſhould be the cauſe of his ceaſing to be.</p>
            <p>The Object then of Believers looking is the unſeen. Eternal God, as their Happineſs <hi>objectively</hi> conſidered, which is ſo <hi>Eternal</hi> as to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning and end; and the enjoyment of this unſeen Eternal God in the inviſible Heavens, which fruition being their happineſs <hi>formally</hi> conſidered, hath a beginning, but no ending.</p>
            <p>Should I follow the ſignification of the Greek word, as looking at a mark we aim at, or an end which we deſire to obtain, I ſhould li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Diſcourſe only to unſeen Eternal good things, but if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a more extended ſenſe, to take heed, to mark, and diligently conſider, I might bring in the unſeen evils in the World to come: and indeed to keep our Eye fixt upon inviſible things, both good and bad, that make Men <hi>Eternally miſerable,</hi> or <hi>Everlaſtingly Bleſſed:</hi> Would have a powerful influence upon every ſtep we take in our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly travels to the unſeen Eternal World.</p>
            <p>To look at unſeen Eternal Evil things, that we might not fall into them:</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>Whether there be an Eternity, into which all men muſt enter, when they go out of Time.</hi> That we might not only ſuppoſe what too many deny, and more doubt of, and ſome are tempted to call into queſtion, but have it proved that no man might <hi>rationally</hi> deny the Eternity of that ſtate in the unſeen World; for upon this lyes the ſtrength of the reaſon in the Text, why Believers look at things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, becauſe they are Eternal: and the object muſt be proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can rationally urge the exerting of the act upon that object.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>How we ſhould Eye Eternity?</hi> or look at Eternal things? For if they be unſeen, how ſhall we ſee them? And if they be to us in this World inviſible, how ſhall we look at them?</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What influence will ſuch a ſight of, and looking at Eternity have upon our Minds, Conſciences, Wills, and Affections in all we do?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="985" facs="tcp:42587:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether there be an Eternity of Happineſs that we ſhould look at to obtain, and of Miſery, to eſcape?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth any queſtion this? Look at Mens Converſations, ſee their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God and Chriſt, their frequent, yea, conſtant refuſals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying Grace; their leading a ſenſual fleſh-pleaſing Life, their ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thoughts of Death and Judgment, their careleſneſs to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for another VVorld, their minding only things Temporal, and then the queſtion may be, who do <hi>indeed believe</hi> that there is ſuch an Eternal ſtate? Yet the real exiſtence and certainty of Eternal things may be evidently manifeſted by Scripture, and by Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If you give aſſent to the Divine Authority of the Scripture,</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the certainty of another World, nor the Eternal ſtate of Souls therein, though this be now unſeen to you. Luk. 20.34. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid, the Children of this World marry</hi> — 35. <hi>but they that ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of that World, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, neither marry; nor are given in marriage.</hi> 36. <hi>Neither can they dye any more, for they are equal to the Angels</hi>—Is not here plain mention of This and That World? and the different ſtate in both? In <hi>this,</hi> Men marry and die; in <hi>that,</hi> they neither marry nor die; yea Chriſt himſelf affirms, that in That World they cannot die; and whatſoever words the Scripture borrows from the beſt things of this World to help our conceptions of the Glorious ſtate of Holy ones in the other World, ſome word denoting the Eternal duration of it, is annexed to them all. Is it called a <hi>Kingdom?</hi> It is an <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.11. a <hi>Crown?</hi> It is a Crown incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. that fadeth not away. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. is it called Glory? is it Eternal Glory. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. an Inheritance? it is incorruptible: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. an Houſe? it is Eternal in the Heavens: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. Salvation? it is Eternal Salvation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Life? it is Eternal Life. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46.</p>
            <p>No leſs certain is the Eternity of the ſtate of the Damned, by the Scriptures adding ſome note of Everlaſting duration to thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things by which their miſery is ſet forth; is it by a Furnace of fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.42. by a Lake of fire? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. it is fire Eternal, and Unquenchable: <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.41. by a Priſon? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. from thence is no coming forth: <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.25, 26. by darkneſs, and blackneſs of darkneſs? it is for ever: <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 13. by burning? it is Everlaſting burning: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. by torment? <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23. the ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth for ever and ever: <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. and 20.10. by Damnation? it is Eternal Damnation: <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.29. by Deſtruction? it is Everlaſting Deſtruction: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. by Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? it is Everlaſting Puniſhment: <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. by the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Worm? it is ſuch that never dyeth: <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.44.46, 48. by wrath that is to come? <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. When it comes,
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:42587:328" rendition="simple:additions"/> it will abide: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. Is any thing more fully and plainly aſſerted in the Scripture, than that the things in the other World, (now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen) are Eternal things? thoſe that enjoy the one in Heaven, and thoſe that now feel the other in Hell, do not, cannot doubt of this: and a little while will put all thoſe that are now in time, quite out of all doubting of the certainty of the Eternity of the ſtate in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Eternity of the unſeen things in Heaven and Hell, the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happy, or Everlaſting Miſerable ſtate after this Life may be evidenced briefly, yet clearly by theſe following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>God did from Eternity choſe ſome to be fitted in time to partake of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all Eternity.</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy</hi>—and being made holy, ſhall be happy in obtaining that Salvation to which he choſe us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13 — <hi>God hath from the Beginning choſen you to Salvation</hi> — 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>— which Salvation doth include abſence of all evil, and preſence of all good; and this Salvation being Eternal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. infers the abſence of all evil for ever, and the preſence of all good for ever, and whoſoever is delivered from all privative Evils, and poſſeſſed of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Everlaſting good, and that for ever, can not be denyed to be happy for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed ſome to be infallibly brought to Eternal Glory.</hi> What reaſon can be given of the Incarnation and Death of the Son of God, if there be no Eternal miſery for men to be delivered from, nor any Eternal happineſs to be poſſeſſed of? For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Did Chriſt dye to deliver his Followers from Poverty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? from Sorrow and Sufferings, from Trouble and Tribulation? What! and yet his Holy, Humble, and Sincere people lye under theſe more than other Men that are wicked and ungodly; why was <hi>Paul</hi> then in ſtripes and impriſonments, in hunger and thirſt, in cold and nakedneſs, in perils and jeopardy of his Life continually: and ſuch as <hi>Pilate, Faelix,</hi> and <hi>Feſtus</hi> in great worldly proſperity? Or can it be imagined, that Men perſiſting in Sin ſhould be more partakers of the fruits of Chriſts Death, than thoſe that forſake their ſin, repent and turn, and follow him?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Did Chriſt ſuffer and dye to purchaſe only Temporal good things, as Riches, Honours, for his Diſciples? Were theſe worth his precious Blood? VVhatever Chriſt dyed for, it coſt him his moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Blood: Was it then, for Temporal enjoyments only, which <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may and do poſſeſs more than Thouſands of his true and faithful Followers? Did Chriſt intend the benefits of his Death for theſe in more eſpecial manner, then for ſuch as remain finally impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and yet ſhall ſuch reap the fruit of all his Sufferings, and
<pb n="987" facs="tcp:42587:328" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe that believe on him, go without them? Sober reaſon doth abhor it, and all the Scripture is againſt it. Would Chriſt have humbled himſelf to ſuch a contemptible Birth, miſerable Life, lamentable, painful, ſhameful Death only for tranſitory, temporal, fading Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? If we conſider the <hi>variety</hi> of his ſufferings from God, Men and Devils, the <hi>dignity</hi> of the Sufferer, I profeſs I cannot imagine any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Chriſts undertakings and performances, if there be not an Eternal ſtate of Miſery in ſuffering of evil things, by his Death that Believers might be delivered from, and of Glory in enjoying of good things, to be brought unto.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Spirit of God doth ſanctifie ſome that they might be made meet to be partakers of the Eternal Inheritance of the Saints in light:</hi> As all are not Godly, ſo all are not Ungodly: Though moſt be as they were born, yet many there be that are born again: there is a wonderful diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt men and men: the Spirit of God infuſing a principle of ſpiritual Life, and making ſome all over new, working in them Faith in Chriſt, Holy Fear and Love, Patience and Hope, longing Deſires, renewing in them the Holy Image of God, is as the earneſt and firſt fruits aſſuring of them in due time of a plentiful harveſt of Everlaſting Happineſs. <hi>Faith</hi> is in order to Eternal Life and Salvation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Love</hi> hath the promiſe of it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Obedience</hi> ends in it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Hope</hi> waits for it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. and becauſe their hope ſhall never make them aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. therefore there muſt be ſuch an Eternal-Bleſſed ſtate they hope for.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Souls of all men are immortal:</hi> though they had a beginning, yet ſhall never ceaſe to be, therefore muſt while they be, be in ſome ſtate, and becauſe they be Eternal, muſt be in ſome Eternal ſtate. This Eternal ſtate muſt be either in the Souls enjoyment of God, or in ſeparation from him; for the wit of Man cannot find out a third: for the Soul continuing to be, muſt be with God, or not with God; ſhall enjoy him, or not enjoy him; for to ſay he ſhall, and ſhall not; or to ſay he ſhall not, and yet ſhall, is a contradiction; and to ſay he neither ſhall, nor ſhall not, is as bad: if therefore the Soul be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and while it ſhall be, ſhall perfectly enjoy God, it ſhall be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy. If it ſhall for ever be, and that without God, it ſhall be Eternally miſerable, becauſe God is the chiefeſt good, the ultimate end, and perfection of man: The great work in this then is to prove that the Soul is Eternal, and ſhall for ever be: For which I offer theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is nothing within, nor without the Soul, that can be the cauſe of its ceaſing to be:</hi> (here except God, who though he can take away the being of Souls, and Angels too, yet he hath abundantly aſſured us that he will not.) Nothing within it, becauſe it is a Spiritual Being, and hath no Internal Principle by contrary qualities, cauſing a ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Being; and becauſe it is ſimple and indiviſible, it is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="988" facs="tcp:42587:329" rendition="simple:additions"/> and incorruptible, for that which is not compounded of parts, cannot be diſſolved into parts, and where there is no diſſolution of a Being, there is no corruption or end of it; there is no Creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; that can cauſe the Soul to ceaſe. Matth. 10.28. <hi>Not able to kill the Soul.</hi> Luc. 12.4. <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do:</hi> if they would kill the Soul, they cannot, when they have killed the Body, they have done their worſt, their moſt, their all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Soul of man hath not dependance upon the Body, as to its Being and Exiſtence.</hi> It hath certain actings and operations which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Body, and if the operations of the Soul be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Body, ſuch muſt the principle be from whence ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do ariſe: and if it can act without dependance on the Body, then it can exiſt, and be without the Body, In the Body without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Body; it hath the knowledge of immaterial Beings, as God and Adgels, which were never ſeen by the eye of the Body, nor can, becauſe there muſt be ſome proportion between the object and the faculty; and the Soul doth know it ſelf, wherein it hath no need of the phantaſie, for when it is intimately preſent to it ſelf, it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the miniſtry of the phantaſie to its own intellection. Beſides it can conceive of univerſals, abſtracted from its ſingulars, in which it doth not depend upon the phantaſie, for <hi>phantaſmata ſunt ſingularium, non univerſalium;</hi> therefore ſince it can act in the body without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Body, it can exiſt without the Body, and not dye when the Body doth; which yet is more plain and certain from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which telleth us that the Soul of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> after death, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.22. but they did not carry it dead or alive, but alive, and not dead. <hi>Stephen</hi> when dying expected the continuance of his Soul in being, and its entrance into Bliſ. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. <hi>ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> The Thief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs had a promiſe from Chriſt, that that day he ſhould be with him in Paradiſe: in his Body he is not yet, therefore in his Soul without the Body; therefore the Soul doth exiſt without the Body. <hi>Paul</hi> believed the Immortality of his Soul, and its exiſtence after the death of his Body. Phil. 1.23. <hi>I am in a ſtrait, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> If his Soul had not exiſted, he had not been a moment ſooner with Chriſt, nay, his Soul in the Body had ſome communion with Chriſt, if it dyed with the Body, it had none, and that was not far better, but worſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The original of the Soul by immediate Creation</hi> is uſually brought as an argument of the Immortality and Continuance of it to Eternity; to aſſert the Creation of the Soul hath this difficulty attending on it, how to clear the propagating of Original Sin: to affirm the Soul is <hi>extraduce</hi> propagated by generation, hath this knot to be untied, how it doth conſiſt with the Immortality of the Soul; when that which is generable is corruptible; but I for preſent ſhall take their arguing which prove it ſhall exiſt for ever, becauſe it is created immediately
<pb n="989" facs="tcp:42587:329" rendition="simple:additions"/> by God according to the worne axiom whatſoever is <hi>ingenerable, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo incorruptible:</hi> The Soul cannot be from the Matter or Bodies of the Parents, becauſe that which is Spiritual and Immaterial cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of that which is a Corporeal and Material Subſtance, for then the effect would be more noble than its cauſe, and the cauſe would give and impart ſomething to the effect which it ſelf hath not, but that which any thing hath not, it cannot give to another; as in a Spiritual, ſo in a Natural ſenſe, that which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; but the Soul is a Spirit.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Souls of the Children from the Souls of the Parents, either by Multiplication, or Diviſion; not by <hi>Diviſion;</hi> that part of the Souls of the Parents ſhould be communicated, and paſs from the Parents to the Children, becauſe it is a Spirit, and therefore indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into parts becauſe it hath none, being without matter, therefore without quantity, therefore without diviſible parts.</p>
            <p>Not by <hi>Multiplication,</hi> for this muſt be by participation of ſomething from the Parents Souls, or not: if not, then it inferreth Creation, for that which is brought out of nothing into being is created; if by participation of ſomething of the ſubſtance of the Parents Soul, this infers Diviſion, which before was ſhewed cannot be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Soul ſhall never dye, but abide to all Eternity. I argue, <hi>either God, neither can, nor will maintain the Soul in Eternal duration, or he would but cannot, or he could but will not, or he both can and will.</hi> If he cannot, then God is not Omnipotent, for the Soul being a Spirit, it no more implies a contradiction that the Soul ſhould live for ever, then that Angels and Devils <hi>ſhould live for ever.</hi> If he can, and any ſay he will not, I deſire a reaſon of this aſſertion: how ſhall any man know Gods Will, by but what he hath revealed; and God hath not revealed that he will not maintain the Souls of men in Eternal Being, but the contrary. It follows then that God both can and will, and therefore they muſt live to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The certainty of an Eternal State in the other unſeen world is evident from <hi>the innate appetite univerſally in all men after Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> There is no man but would be happy, and there is no man that would have his happineſs ceaſe: a man might as ſoon ceaſe to be a man, as caſt away all deſires of Happineſs, or Will to be for ever miſerable, though moſt miſtake what their happineſs is. This innate Appetite cannot be filled with all the good things in this World; for though the rational appetite be <hi>ſubjectively</hi> finite, yet it is <hi>objectively</hi> infinite. God therefore and Nature which do nothing in vain, hath put unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, reſtleſs deſires after happineſs into the hearts of men, which cannot be any thing among things ſeen, and Temporal, there muſt be ſomething that muſt be the object of this Appetite, and able to quiet and fill it in the other world, though moſt by folly, blindneſs, and ſloathfulneſs miſs of it.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="990" facs="tcp:42587:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>VI. The <hi>abſurdities which follow the denyal of an Eternal ſtate</hi> of men (though now unſeen) demonſtrate the certainty of it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>then the lives of men,</hi> even of the beſt, muſt needs be uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and the life of reaſon would (as ſuch) be ſubject to more fears and terrors than the life of ſenſe, which is againſt all ſenſe and reaſon; for Beaſts muſt dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do not foreſee that they muſt dye; but the rational foreſight of Death would imbitter all his ſweeteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Life; if there were no reaſon to hope for another after this; and the more the Life of Man as Man is more noble than the Life of Beaſts, the more the foreſight of the certain loſs thereof without another after this, would affright, afflict, torment: Now it is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to think, that God who made Man the chiefeſt, and the choiceſt of all his viſible works, ſhould endue him with ſuch powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Underſtanding and Will to make his Life (as man) more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, by being filled with fretting fears, wracking griefs, and tormenting terrors, more than any Beaſts are liable to, or capable of. Nay, and add, that the more any Man did improve, exerciſe, and uſe his reaſon in the frequent Meditations of Death, the more bitter his Life would be, to conſider that all the preſent good he doth enjoy, muſt certainly and ſhortly be loſt by Death, and he not capable of any good after Death in the ſtead and room thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Then the Condition of many wicked,</hi> yea, the worſt of men would be better than the condition of the godly that are the beſt; if the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have their good things here, and no evil hereafter; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God their evil things here, and no good hereafter; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we had hope, we were of all men moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Then the chiefeſt and greateſt encouragements</hi> to undergo Sufferings and Loſſes for Gods ſake were taken away. Why did <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſe the Honours of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court: and choſe to ſuffer Afflictions with the People of God; but becauſe he had his Eye to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. Why did <hi>Paul</hi> endure ſuch Conflicts, but for the hope of Life and Immortality which the Goſpel had brought to light: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10, 12. and well might he ask what it would advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage him that he fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> if the Dead riſe not to Eternal happineſs. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. Might not then the Suffering Saints repent when they come to dye, that they had been ſo imprudent and unwiſe, to endure ſo much, and loſe ſo much, and ſay they have been loſers by obeying God, and by their holy walking, for there is no happineſs after Death to be hoped for: wherefore I do repent that I did not take my pleaſures while I might; but did you ever here a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous godly man, when dying, utter ſuch words? But on the contrary on their dying beds do grieve and groan, mourn and lament, that they have been no more holy and obedient; and in ſuffering times, if they had Gold as Duſt, they would count it all as Droſs; and if they had a thouſand lives, they would loſe them all to keep in the favour
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:42587:330" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God, and to gain the Crown of Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Then would the Floodgates of ſin</hi> and profaneneſs be plucked up, to let in an Inundation of all manner of groſs abominations; for if men will not be afrighted from their ſin with all the threatnings of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt pains of Hell, nor allured to leave them with all the promiſes of the ſweeteſt pleaſures of Heaven; if they were ſure there were no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell to be adjudged to, nor Glory in Heaven to be rewarded by, they would run with greater greedineſs to the commiſſion of the worſt of ſins that the Devil ſhould tempt them, or their wicked hearts incline them to.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How ſhould we Eye Eternity? or look at unſeen Eternal things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are ſaid to be unſeen, as they are not the objects of our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſe; for in this ſenſe they are not to be ſeen: but we muſt look at Eternal things that are unſeen, with an Eye that alſo is unſeen; and the ſeveral things denoted by the Eyes in Scripture, will give ſome light to ſee, with what Eyes we muſt look at unſeen Eternal things; <hi>viz.</hi> with an Eye of
<list>
                  <item>Knowledge,</item>
                  <item>Faith,</item>
                  <item>Love.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Our looking at Eternal things comprehends theſe acts of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It includes <hi>a ſure and certain Knowledge of them:</hi> as things not underſtood are ſaid to be hid from our Eyes; ſo what we know, we are ſaid to ſee. Eccleſ. 2.3. <hi>I ſought in my heart-till I might ſee what was that good for the Sons of men.</hi>—taking away of Knowledge is called the putting out of the Eyes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.14. and the inlightening the Mind, the opening of the Eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. and Looking is put for certain Knowing, <hi>Job</hi> 13.27. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. and expreſſed by See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Act.</hi> 7.34. ſo that the Looking at, and Eying of Eternal things with the Eyes of the Underſtanding, includes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>bending</hi> of the mind to ſtudy them; as when a man would look at any Object, he bends his Head, and turns his Eyes that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The binding of the mind to them, as a man, when he looks earneſtly at any thing, fixeth his Eye upon it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the mind thus bent and bound to Eternal things, that it is often thinking on the unſeen Eternal God, Chriſt, Heaven, and the Life to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Looking is by <hi>an Eye of Faith.</hi> Looking is believing, Numb. 21.8. <hi>Make thee a fiery ſerpent, and ſet it upon a pole: and it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, ſhall live.</hi> The Object and the Act are both expounded by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="992" facs="tcp:42587:331" rendition="simple:additions"/> 3.14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up.</hi> 15. <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Having opened the Eyes with which we are to look at Eternal things, I proceed to the manner of our Looking: There is a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unto</hi> them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. There is a Looking <hi>into</hi> them, by ſtudying the Nature of them, to know more of the reality, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and dignity of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> If Angels do, Men ſhould. There is a looking for them, either as we look for things that we have loſt, look till we find, as the Man for his loſt Sheep, or the Woman for her loſt Silver. <hi>Luc.</hi> 15.4.8. or to look for a thing that is yet to come: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. and there is a looking at them, which is not an idle gazing at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Eternal World, but a practical lively, affecting look in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould look at Eternal things with ſuch an Eye of Faith, that <hi>ſhould preſentiate them unto us, though they are yet to come.</hi> Hence Faith is ſaid to be the ſubſtance, or <hi>ſubſiſtence of things not ſeen, and the evidence of things hoped for.</hi> Heb. 11.1. Faith ſo looks at things that are far off, that they have a kind of mental, intellectual exiſtence; though abſent as if they were preſent: being promiſed as ſure, as if they
<pb n="993" facs="tcp:42587:331" rendition="simple:additions"/> were already poſſeſſed: Faith convinceth and aſſureth the heart of a Believer moſt ſtrongly of the truth of a thing, while it looks to the Revelation and Teſtimony of God, than any argument brought forth from Natural reaſon could do; and doth give as firm aſſent to the certainty and reality of Eternal things (though unſeen) as to any thing he beholdeth with his eyes, or perceiveth by the apprehenſion of any Senſe; becauſe our Eyes may be deceived, but God neither can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor be deceived.</p>
            <p>Look then, <hi>e. g.</hi> at the coming of Chriſt with ſuch an Eye of Faith, as if with your bodily Eyes you ſaw him deſcending from Heaven, in flaming fire, with glorious attendance; as if you heard the Trumpet ſounding, and the Cry made, <hi>ariſe ye Dead, and come to Judgment:</hi> at which command, as if you ſaw the Dead quickned, and peeping out of their Graves, to ſee why they are raiſed: as if you ſaw the wicked come forth, fearfully amazed, with vile and filthy Bodies, like Toads from their holes, with pale and gaſtly countenances, with trembling hearts, and their knees for horrour knocking one againſt another, tearing their hair, ſmiting on their breaſts, and crying out, what is the matter! What meant that loud Alarm, that thundring Call that awaked us out of the deep ſleep of Death? Oh! the Lord is come, the ſlighted Chriſt is come: Come! how doth he come? How? cloathed with vengeance, with fury in his face, and his wrath like fire burns before him: becauſe of his Indignation, the Heavens melt over our heads, and the Earth burns under our feet, and all is in flames round about us. Oh terrible day! ſuch as this we never ſaw. Oh the ſtorms! the ſtorms! Oh ſuch burning, ſcorching ſtorms we never ſaw, nor felt before! We have been ſleeping all the night of Death, and the morning is come, the day doth dawn: Dawn! Oh it is broad day all about, we were wont to wake, and go to work, and go to ſin, to ſwear, and lye, to drink and take our pleaſure, but now we wake, and muſt to Hell, to Pain, and Puniſhment. Now we muſt go from God to Devils, from the only Saviour, to Eternal Torments. Oh what day is this! What day! it ſeems to be rather night than day, for it is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and diſtreſs, a day of waſtneſs and deſolation, a day of darkneſs and gloomineſs, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs; a day of the trumpet and alarm againſt us all Impenitent Sinners, and to us all it would prove the great Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation day. When our Souls and Bodies by Death were ſeparated, it was a ſorrowful parting, but this is a ſorer meeting: the Body with doleful groans doth ſtrangely greet its reunited Soul. Oh thou cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Soul! muſt I be tyed to thee again with a faſter knot than ever? Death did heretofore part thee and me, but all the pains of Hell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after cannot do it: thou waſt Commander over me, and ſhouldſt have managed thy Government better: thou ſhouldſt have uſed this Tongue to call upon thy Maker: thou ſhouldeſt have uſed theſe Ears to have hearkned to the calls of Chriſt, to the wooings of Grace, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of Mercy: theſe feet to have carryed thee to the means of
<pb n="994" facs="tcp:42587:332" rendition="simple:additions"/> Grace: theſe hands to have been Inſtruments of good, they were all at thy command, what thou biddeſt them do, they did, and whither thou commandeſt them to go, they went: Oh that I might have lyen rotten in my Grave, for then I had been at reſt! for though in the Grave I had no pleaſure, yet there I felt no pain: but ſince I have been again united to this before-damned Soul, I feel intolerable puniſhment, and I now perceive it is paſt doubt that it will be Eternal; the Soul will give no better ſalutations to the Body. Oh curſed fleſh! what, alive again! Muſt I be linked to ſuch a loathſome lump, worſe than any Carrion? thou didſt rebel againſt the commands of reaſon, and thy Appetite was pleaſed, and thy Luſts were obeyed, and all the time of Life on Earth was ſpent, and fool'd away, in feeding, clothing, and adorning thee; and as I was led away, and entic'd by thee to live with thee a ſenſual, fleſh-pleaſing life, ſo formerly ſowing to the fleſh, now of the fleſh we reap that Damnation that ſhall be Eternal. For the Judge is come, his Throne is ſet, and all the World is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear, the ſeparation is made, the Books are opened, all on the right hand are acquitted, and called to the poſſeſſion of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, while we are doom'd down to Eternal Torments. Lo! they are going with their Bleſſed Glorious Lord unto Eternal Glory: and we with curſed Devils, like curſed Wretches to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhame, and pain, and baniſhment from God and Chriſt, and Saints and Angels for ever.</p>
            <p>Look thus believingly on theſe unſeen things, as if you ſaw all theſe, and a thouſand times more terrible and more joyful, tranſacted now before your eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Look directly at unſeen Eternal things.</hi> Many do look indirectly at things Eternal, but directly at things Temporal; pretending things not ſeen, intending things that are ſeen; in praying, preaching, and profeſſing ſeem to have an eye to God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, but they look aſquint to their worldly profits, credit and applauſe: Should pray that they might ſee God, but it is that they might be ſeen of Men: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. But this is to look awry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Solomons</hi> adviſe. Prov. 4.25. <hi>Let thine Eyes look right on, and let thine Eye-lids look ſtraight before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let unſeen <hi>Eternal things be the firſt that you look at.</hi> Do not firſt look at Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, and pleaſe your ſelves with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes after that, to look after God and Chriſt, and the happineſs of Heaven, when ſickneſs cometh, and Death approacheth, and when near the end of time, begin to make preparation for Eternity. Men ſpend their days in getting a viſible ſtate, while the unſeen Eternal God, and Glorious Saviour, and Heavens Happineſs is neglected by them; but it would make a conſidering man to tremble to think what a ſight theſe Sinners ſhall have after Death hath cloſed their eyes, when the ſeparated Soul ſhall ſee an angry God, a condemning Judge,
<pb n="995" facs="tcp:42587:332" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Gates of Heaven ſhut againſt it, and its ſelf in Everlaſting miſery.</p>
            <p>Unſeen Eternal things are firſt in order of <hi>duration,</hi> for the inviſible God was, when nothing was beſides himſelf; and firſt in order of <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and ſhould have the priority of our <hi>thoughts,</hi> care, and diligent <hi>endeavours.</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> When we firſt take care about Eternity, the things of time ſhall be given to us over and above: but the Eternal happineſs of Heaven ſhall never be given over and above to thoſe that primarily look at, and ſeek the things of time, for amongſt men, the overplus doth not exceed in worth the things contracted for.</p>
            <p>But this damnable preferring things Temporal, and curſed poſt-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things Eternal, is the ſetting of God in the room of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Creature in the Throne of God, as if they would ſet the Heavens where the Earth doth ſtand, and the Earth where the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are, and ſo ſubvert the order of things which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be obſerved in the Nature of things.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look <hi>heedfully at Eternity.</hi> All the things that are only for time, are toyes and trifles: the things for an Eternal World are the grand concerns we ſhould narrowly look to in time; the gathering of Riches in time to the getting of Grace, and an intereſt in Chriſt for the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Damnation, and obtaining of Happineſs to Eternity is <hi>buſie Idleneſs, careful Negligence,</hi> and <hi>laborious Sloth.</hi> If God that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Eternity looks narrowly to all our actions done in time, <hi>Job</hi> 13.27. how narrowly ſhould we look to our own, when every one is a ſtep to Everlaſting Happineſs, or Eternal Miſery? We ſhould look narrowly that we do not walk in the broad way that leads unto the one, but in the narrow that will bring us to the other. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Look <hi>Earneſtly</hi> with a longing look at unſeen Eternal things. Let your Hearts be filled with greateſt intenſe deſires after them, as one that looks and thinks it long, till the deſire be accompliſhed: as the Mother of <hi>Siſera</hi> looked out at a Window, and cryed through the Lattice, <hi>Why is his Chariot ſo long in coming? Why tarry the Wheels of his Chariot? Jud.</hi> 5.28. Why doth time make no more haſte to be gone, and flee away, that when it is gone and paſt, I might enter into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joyes, that never ſhall be paſt and gone? Why doth the Sun, that by its alternate preſence and abſence, is the meaſure of my nights and dayes, make no ſwifter ſpeed in its diurnal Motion? If it be as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming out of his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run a race, why doth it ſeem to my longing Soul, (as in the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi>) to ſtand ſtill? If the Sun in the Firmament be ſo ſlow, let the Sun of Righteouſneſs make more haſte, and come, and lighten my paſſage to the other Eternal World, that I might ſee him as he is, and be more like unto him, then at this diſtance I can be? <hi>Return, Return, O Shulamite, return, return, that I might look upon thee: Make haſte my
<pb n="996" facs="tcp:42587:333" rendition="simple:additions"/> Beloved, and be thou like unto a roe, or to a young hart upon the Mountains of ſpices,</hi> that my looking for, and after thee might be turned into look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thee. Didſt thou ſay a little while, and ye ſhall ſee me, and again, a little while, and ye ſhall not ſee me? Why deareſt Lord! ſhall I count that a little while, in which I do not ſee thee? haſt thou left it upon record, <hi>yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry?</hi> Sweeteſt Saviour! to my thirſty, panting Soul, it ſeems a great while, while thou doſt tarry, and not come: time ſeems long till I do ſee thee, but when I ſhall ſee thee in looking on thy lovely, glorious Self, Eternity ſhall not ſeem long. I will mind thee of thy promiſe, <hi>ſurely I come quickly,</hi> and make it matter of my prayer, and in confidence of the performance of thy promiſe, and audience of my Prayer will ſay, <hi>Amen, even ſo, ſo quickly come Lord Jeſus:</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my earneſt expectation, and my hope, I groan, and am tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in pain, until I ſee thee who to me art now unſeen, that then I might live by ſight, and no longer walk by Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Look though with Earneſt, yet with <hi>Patient expectation,</hi> at unſeen Eternal things. He that walketh now by Faith, that he ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter live by ſight, will not make undue, untimely haſte; though what he ſeeth by Faith in unſeen Eternal Joyes and Glory, doth fill his Soul with longing deſires after them, yet hope doth help with Patience to wait for them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. For the beatifical Viſion is yet for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, but at the end of Temporal Life it will be given, though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry; though it tarry beyond ſome Moneths or Years that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be there, yet it ſhall not tarry one moment beyond the time, that God hath appointed to take you to it, therefore in the mean time live by Faith, and ſee in things unſeen, what can be ſeen by Faith, till things unſeen, ſhall clearly, and with open face be ſeen by you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Look with a <hi>fixed, ſtedfaſt Eye</hi> at unſeen Eternal things, if you give a glance, or caſt of the Eye towards things ſeen and temporal; the Eye and Heart too is ready to fix upon them: if you would fix your Eye upon Eternity, upon God and Chriſt, and the Joyes above, Satan, Sin, the Fleſh and World will be diverting of it, that now in time, comparatively, you can but glance upon Eternity: If you look that way, many Objects will interpoſe themſelves, to hinder your ſight, and to turn your Eyes from things Eternal, to things Temporal, from God to the Creature, from things above, to things below: But yet if we were full of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Stephen</hi> was, we might look up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, and though not with the ſame Eye, yet to the ſame effect and purpoſe, ſee the Glory of God, and Jeſus, ſtanding on his right hand. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55. Though the thoughts are immanent, yet in this reſpect they are too tranſient, that they do no longer dwell upon Eternity: But if the Devil and the World find your thoughts tyed to this ſubject, and go about to
<pb n="997" facs="tcp:42587:333" rendition="simple:additions"/> looſen them, ſay, why do ye this? <hi>for not my Lord, but I have need of them:</hi> Or if you are at any ſeaſon ſeaſonably got up into the Mount, viewing Eternity, and they ſend Meſſengers to you to come down, reply (for they think to do you miſchief) I am doing a great work, ſo that I cannot come down: Why ſhould the work ceaſe, whileſt I leave it, and come down to you? And though they ſend more than four times after this ſort, yet anſwer them ſtill after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Look <hi>unweariedly</hi> at unſeen Eternal things. The Eye might be fixed for a while upon an Object, and after a while be weary in looking at it; can you look unweariedly at the vanities of this World, and will you be ſo ſoon tired in beholding the Glorious things in the other World? Do you look on things Temporal, where ſeeing is not ſatisfying, and yet are never ſatisfyed with looking? And will you not look on things Eternal, where ſeeing would be ſuch a filling of your heart with ſatisfactory content, that looking would not be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to your eye? There is ſo much in God, in Chriſt, in all Eternal things in Heaven; ſo much Beauty, Glory, Fulneſs, that methinks we might ſtand looking at them night and day, without any irkſomneſs at all. But alas, when the Spirit is willing, the Fleſh is weak; and whileſt the Soul muſt look out of Fleſh to ſee thoſe Glorious things, and ſo clogged with Corruption, that is like duſt within its Eyes, that makes it weep, becauſe it can look no longer: but yet in time we ſhould endeavour to be more like to them that are already in that Eternity, where they look at God and Chriſt unweariedly: and though their looking is not meaſured by Days, or Moneths, or Years, but by immenſurable Eternity, yet they ſhall never be weary of looking at them to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Look with <hi>a joyful pleaſant Eye</hi> at unſeen Eternal things. Look till you feel your Heart to leap for joy; look till you find your Spirit is reviv'd within you; look till the ſight of your Eye affect your Heart. Is Chriſt <hi>unſeen?</hi> yet not <hi>unknown:</hi> Do not you now ſee him with bodily Eyes, yet you do with an Eye of Faith and Love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. When you look up unto the Heavens, and ſee and ſay, yonder is the place of my Everlaſting abode, there I muſt dwell with God, there I muſt be with Chriſt, and joyfully joyn with Angels and Saints in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my Lord and Saviour; the foreſight of this will make you joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the preſent, and pleaſant in your looking at it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Look <hi>fiducially</hi> at unſeen Eternal things, with an Holy, Humble Confidence by Jeſus Chriſt upon the performance of the conditions of the Goſpel, they ſhall be all your own; that by turning from all your Sin, by Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, you truſt, you ſhall be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of them; that when you ſee there are Manſions now unſeen, there are Eternal Joyes, an Immoveable Kingdom, an Incorruptible
<pb n="998" facs="tcp:42587:334" rendition="simple:additions"/> Crown, the Eternal God to be enjoyed, and for all this you have a promiſe, and you know this promiſe is made to you, by the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Conditions annexed to the promiſe, you truſt in time to come unto it, or rather when you go out of time into Eternity, you ſhall be bleſſed in the Immediate, Full, Eternal Enjoyment of all the Happineſs that God hath prepared in Heaven, to give you wellcome, joyful entertainment in that unſeen Eternal World; that you ſo eye that World while you live in this, that when by Death you are going out of this World, into that, you might have this well-grounded confidence to ſay, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous judge ſhall give me at that day</hi>—2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8.</p>
            <p>If you get ſuch a ſight as this, as now hath been ſet forth before you, upon ſuch Eternal Objects as before were propounded to you, you will be able from your own experience to anſwer the third queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the general caſe; but yet I will proceed unto that branch.</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What influence will ſuch an Eying of Eternity have upon us in all we do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all we do? Will its Influence be ſo Univerſal? Will the efficacy of ſuch a ſight be ſo extenſive to reach forth its virtue in all we do? yes, in all we do. Whether we Eat, or Drink, or go to Sleep, whether we Trade, or Work, or Buy, or Sell. Whether we Pray, or Hear, or ſearch our Hearts, or Meditate, or Receive, or Study, or Preach, or Sin, or Suffer, or Dy, it will have a mighty influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in any thing wherein we are active, or paſſive, culpable, or praiſe-worthy; in any condition, be it Poverty, or Riches, Health, or Sickneſs; in any Relation, be it of Husband and Wife; of Parents and Children, of Maſters and Servants: In any <hi>Office</hi> and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sacred or Civil; out of ſuch an heap (becauſe I am limited) I will take an handful, and becauſe I have not room to ſpeak of all, I will not caſt them into method, according to their nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and dependance one upon another, but take them as they come in ſome few particulars only.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such an Eyeing of Eternity in all we do would make us careful <hi>to avoid Sin in any thing we do,</hi> or however we might fail in all we do yet that we ſuffer it not to Reign, or have Dominion over us. Look at Eternity with a believing Eye, and you will look at ſin with an angry Eye: you will caſt a deadly look at Sin, when you have a lively look at Eternity of Joy or Miſery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sin would deprive me of Eternal Life,</hi> therefore I will be its Death; it would keep me from Eternal Reſt: therefore I will never reſt, till I have conquered and ſubdued it; nothing in the World would bring upon my Eternal Soul, the Eternal loſs of the Eternal God, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son, and Holy Spirit, of the Company of his Holy Angels and
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:42587:334" rendition="simple:additions"/> Saints, of Eternal Treaſures, of a Bleſſed Kingdom, and Incorruptible Crown<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but curſed Sin: Poverty, Sickneſs, Men, Death, Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; nothing but Sin: therefore I will be its bane, that ſhall not Reign in me, that would not ſuffer me to live in Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin would plunge me into unſeen Eternal Torments,</hi> into Endleſs Flames, and Everlaſting Burnings: If you could ſpeak with a Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted but a Moneth ago, and ask him, what do you now think of the delights of Sin, of ſporting on the Sabbath day, of your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Cups, and Delightful Games; of pleaſing of the Fleſh, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of its Luſts? What a ſad reply would he return, and what a doleful anſwer would he make you? Sin! Oh, that was it that was my ruine; that was it, which hath brought me (miſerable wretch) to Everlaſting Torment; that was it, which ſhut me out of Heaven, that ſunk me down to Hell. O ye fooliſh Sons of Men, that are yet in time, be not mad, as I was mad; and do not do as I did: let not the ſeen pleaſures and profits of the World, which I have found, were but for a time, deceive you, and bewitch you: the Devil ſhewed me the ſeen delights of Sin, but concealed from me the Extremity and Eternity of the pain that it hath brought me to; the pleaſure is paſt, and the pain continues, and I am loſt for ever; and all this Sin hath brought me to. Let your eyeing of Eternity whilſt you are ſtanding in time, be inſtead of ones ſpeaking to you in time, that hath been in Eternity, for the Eternal God doth tell you, as much as any Damned Soul can tell you, and would you believe one from Hell, and not the Son of God that came from Heaven? Oh look and view Eternity in the Glaſs of the Scripture, and firmly believe it, and it will make ſlaughtering work amongſt your Sins, and deſtroy that which would damn you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such Eyeing of Eternity would be a mighty help to quiet your hearts under the diſpenſations of Providence here to Men on Earth.</hi> When you look at the ſeen Afflictions, Diſtreſſes, Diſgraces, Stripes, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Perſecutions, and Poverty of the People and Children of God, and the Riches, Eaſe, Honours, Pleaſures, and the ſeen flouriſhing proſperity of the worſt of Men, that by the Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, hating of Godlineſs, being patterns of wickedneſs, proclaim themſelves the Children of the Devil, and you are offended, and your Mind diſquieted, except in this you have a better heart than <hi>Job, cap.</hi> 21.6, to 16. or <hi>David,</hi> a Man after Gods own heart; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2, to 16. or <hi>Jeremiah, cap.</hi> 12.1, 2. or <hi>Habakkuk, cap.</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt the many helps to allay this Temptation, the eyeing of the laſt, yea, Everlaſting things is not the leaſt. Look upon theſe two ſorts of Men, (which comprehend all in the World) as going to Eternity, and lodged there, and then you will rather pity them, becauſe of their future Miſery, then envy them for their preſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. What if they have their Hearts deſire for a moment, and muſt
<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:42587:335" rendition="simple:additions"/> be tormented for ever. What if they have Pleaſures, and carnal Delights for a ſeaſon, they muſt be under the heavy wrath of God for ever. You might ſtand and ſee all their mirth at an end, but their ſorrow never will have end; all their joy is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the crackling of Thorns under a pot, but their miſery will be endleſs miſery. Let them laugh a while, they ſhall weep for ever: let them rejoyce for a ſeaſon, their mirth ſhall be turned into heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; their Temporal rejoycing into Everlaſting howling; and the Eternity of Joy will be more than a recompence to the afflicted Saints, whatſoever their Sufferings for Chriſt, and Conſcience be in this World.</p>
            <p>A ſuppoſed caſe might be an help in this Temptation. Suppoſe then that you were poor, and full of pain for ſo long time, or rather for ſo ſhort, that you ſhould fall aſleep, and after you awake, ſhould be poor no more, nor afflicted any more, but have a Life of manly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights afterwards. Suppoſe again, another man were compaſſed about with all manner of accommodations; coſtly Diſhes to pleaſe his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, beautiful Objects to delight his Eyes, all manner of Muſick grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Ears; many Servants to attend him; all ſtanding bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and bowing the knee in Honour to him; and all this, and much more, he were to enjoy as long as he could abſtain from ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but aſſoon as he doth fall aſleep, he ſhould be taken off his Bed, and caſt into a Furnace of boyling Lead, or ſcalding Pitch. I demand which of theſe two Mens Condition you would chooſe; I know it would be the condition of the former, and not the latter; this, and infinitely beyond this is the caſe in hand; you are afflicted till you fall aſleep, and then you ſhall be afflicted no more, but live a life of Joy for ever! the Wicked proſper till they fall aſleep, and they cannot long keep open their Eyes, but Death will come and cloſe them, then the juſtice of God will arreſt them, and then Devils will ſeize upon them, and they ſhall be caſt into a Lake of burning Brimſtone, where they ſhall have no reſt, night, nor day; but the ſmoak of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall aſcend for ever and ever. Exerciſe your thoughts in this manner, and have an Eye unto Eternity, and you will more eaſily and ſucceſsfully overcome ſuch Temptations to murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from the different diſpenſations of the Providence of God here, in time to good and bad.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such eyeing of Eternity would have great influence <hi>for the well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our time.</hi> Time is to be valued in order to Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we go out of time into Eternity, (and that which ſhould make every Man in time moſt concerned) out of time into Eternity of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Glory. Oh! what a pretious thing is Time! it is beyond the worth of Gold or Silver, becauſe we might do more in time in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Eternity, than we can do by all our Gold and Silver: Jewels are but Toyes in compariſon of pretious Time. Many are ſaving of their Money, but are prodigal of Time; and have more of Time
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:42587:335" rendition="simple:additions"/> then they know what to do with, when others find ſo much to do, that they know not what to do for time to do it in. Oh Fools, and blind, what were an Hundred years to make preparation for Eternity? Oh ſluggiſh careleſs Sots! Do you ask, how ſhall we paſs away the time? Might ye not with more reaſon ask, how ſhall we prevent haſty time from paſſing away with ſuch winged motion? Or if that cannot be prevented, How ſhall we improve our time that is ſo faſt a poſting from us? Blind World! Do any Men in thee enquire, How ſhall we ſpend our time? It is eaſily anſwered, in Praying, Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, begging for Grace, the pardon of Sin, the favour of God, and peace with Him, and fitneſs for Eternal Life. Had the Damned in Hell the time that once they had, and you now have, do you think they would ask what they ſhould do to paſs away the time? Their cry rather is, Oh haſty time, whither art thou fled? Why didſt thou move ſo faſt while we ſate ſtill? Or why in time did we ſo ſwiftly run in ways of Sin, as if we could not have ſinned enough before time was paſt and gone? When we had a God to ſerve, and Souls to ſave, and an Everlaſting State to make preparation for, we like Fools did ſay, How ſhall we ſpend our time? But now our time is ſpent, and paſt, and gone; and now the queſtion is, which never can be anſwered, How ſhall we ſpend Eternity? which never can be ſpent, no not in enduring Ten Thouſand Thouſand Millions of Years in pain and puniſhment; for when they are paſt, it is as freſh, and as far from ending, as it was the firſt moment it began; then Eye Eternity, and you cannot but improve your time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Such Eyeing of Eternity would make us careful how we die,</hi> becauſe Death is our paſſing out of time into Eternity. Death is dreadful to the ungodly, becauſe it opens the door into Everlaſting Miſery; gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all endued with ſaving Grace, becauſe it lets them in to Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs. Did you that are yet Chriſtleſs, Impenitent, and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſee whither you are going, and where you muſt within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time take up your Everlaſting Lodgings; what fear and trembling would ſeize upon all your joynts, and when by ſickneſs you perceive Death to be approaching, you would cry out, Oh Death, forbear, forbear, ſtay thine hand, and do not ſtrike, for if thou cut me down in this condition, I drop into Eternal Miſery: there is nothing but this ſingle thred of my frail Life between me and endleſs wo, and if this be cut or ſnapt aſunder, I ſink in to irrecoverable Miſery, without all hope of ever coming forth: Could you but ſee a Soul the next hour after its ſeparation from the Body, what a taking it is in, what wo, what deſpair it is filled with, would you then live without Chriſt, go to bed without Chriſt, and riſe and trade, and ſtill remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Intereſt in Chriſt? What mean ye <hi>ſirs,</hi> to make no proviſion for Death that is ſo near, ſo very near, when you are as near to going into an Everlaſting World, as you are to going out of this Tranſitory World? and your Souls be dragged ſooner by Devils into Hell, than your
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:42587:336" rendition="simple:additions"/> Bodies can be carryed by Men unto your Graves. Awake, ariſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn unto the Lord, for if you ſleep on in ſin, till you ſleep by Death, you will be awaked by the flames of Hell; and then though you be under the power of Eternal Death, you will ſleep no more, and reſt no more for ever.</p>
            <p>And Death is as gainful and deſirable to a Gracious Man, as it is terrible to the Ungodly, for it lets him into unſeen Eternal Glory, to the ſight of Chriſt unſeen to us on Earth: How willing would you be to go a Thouſand Miles to ſee Chriſt, and converſe with him, if he were on Earth, it is better to ſee this pretious Chriſt in Eternal Glory: it is worth the while to dy, to have a view of your Lord-Redeemer in the higheſt Heavens. Oh the wonderful tranſporting Joyes the Soul is filled with, when it firſt cometh into the unſeen, but happy World! when it hath the firſt Glorious view of its deareſt Lord. Do you think it would deſire to return to live in fleſh upon Earth again? Do you know what you do, when you are ſo loth to dy? Do you underſtand your ſelves when you are ſo backward to be taken out of time? It is to be loth, to go into Everlaſting Happineſs, to go and take poſſeſſion of unſeen Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Such an Eyeing of Eternity would make us more patient, conſtant, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all our ſufferings for Chriſts ſake.</hi> When we poar upon our ſeen troubles, and do not look at reſt after trouble, when we ſee and feel what is inflicted upon us, but do not look what is laid up in Heaven for us; when we ſee the rage of men, and do not look at the love of God, our Hearts and Fleſh do fail; but if we ſet unſeen Eternal things over againſt things ſeen and Temporal, it will be ſtrength unto us. Againſt the power of Men which is Temporal, ſet the Power of God, which is Eternal; and then you will ſee their power to be weakneſs: Againſt the Policy of Men which is Temporal, ſet the Wiſdom of God, which is Eternal, and then you will ſee all their Policy to be Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Againſt the Hatred of Men, which in its effects to you is Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, ſet the Love of God, which is both in its ſelf, and in its effects to you Eternal; and you will ſee their hatred to be no better than raging, unreaſonable madneſs. Keep your Eye upon the unſeen Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other World, and you will rather endure Sufferings in this, than venture upon Sin, and expoſe your ſelves to them: Keep your Eye upon the unſeen Eternal Crown of Glory, and it will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you through Fire and Flames, Priſons and Reproaches for the ſake of Chriſt. Heb. 11.26. <hi>Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt; for he had reſpect unto the recompence of the reward,</hi> 27. <hi>by Faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King: for he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This Eyeing of Eternity will be a powerful preſervative againſt the temptations of Men or Devils;</hi> a Sovereign Antidote againſt the Poyſon of Temptation. I ſee the Inviſible God looks at me, ſhall I then yield
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:42587:336" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the ſuggeſtions of the Devil, or the ſollicitations of men to ſin? I ſee there is an Everlaſting ſtate of Joy or Torment that I muſt be ſhortly in, as ſure as I am in this place, and Satans deſign is to bring me to that ſtate of Torment; and if I follow him, I ſhall be excluded from yonder glorious place; from God, and Chriſt, and Saints above: therefore by the Grace of God I will not yield to this Temptation; but ſtrive I will, and Watch and Pray I will againſt the aſſaults of this deceitful Adverſary: for why ſhould I be ſo fooliſh to loſe Eternal Glory for momentary Pleaſures? and run my Immortal Soul into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pain for ſhort delights? I do plainly ſee what will be the end, if I do yield Damnation without end, baniſhment from God without end: I do clearly ſee that Stealing and Murder is not a more ready road to a place of Execution upon Earth, than yielding to a tempting Devil is to Everlaſting Miſery.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Such Eyeing of Eternity would wean our hearts from the things of time.</hi> A ſight and view of Heavens Glory would darken the Glory of the World, as looking at the ſhining Sun over your Head, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure in your Eyes the things under your Feet; after a believing view of the inviſible God, and the Glory of the place above, this World would appear as a very Dunghil in your Eyes: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. as where we love, there we look; ſo the more we look, the more we ſhall love; and the more we love the Eternal things that are above, the leſs we ſhall love the Temporal things that are below.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Such Eyeing of Eternity would make us more like to God and Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> it will be a transforming and aſſimilating look. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Therefore when we ſhall ſee Chriſt who is now out of ſight, we ſhall be perfectly like unto him. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>But we know when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Such an Eyeing of Eternity would fill our Souls with Holy admirations of the Goodneſs, Grace, and Love of God to us:</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> had a ſight of ſuch unſeen things, he was in an Holy Extaſie and Divine Rapture. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. When we conſider the Eternal Happineſs of Heaven, we ſhall ſtand as Men amazed, that God ſhould prepare ſuch things for ſuch men, and bear ſuch Love, and ſhew ſuch Mercy to ſuch as we that are ſo vile and full of ſin, and ſay, Lord what am I that might for ever have howled in the loweſt Hell, that I ſhould hope to praiſe thee in the higheſt Heavens! Lord, what am I that might have been in Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Darkneſs, that there ſhould be prepared for me Everlaſting Light and Joy! Why me, Lord, why haſt thou deſigned me, and wrought upon my heart, and made me in any meaſure meet to be partaker of ſuch Eternal Glory. Oh! the depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his

            <p n="10">10. Such an Eyeing of Eternity would have this influence ſure upon us, <hi>to ſet our ſelves under a painful, skilful, ſerious Miniſtry:</hi> It doth much concern you, for you are going to an endleſs Life, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the appointed means to fit you for an endleſs happy Life; then do you chooſe the moſt lively, ſearching, powerful Preaching, it is for the life of your Souls; for the Everlaſting life of your Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Souls. If you were ſick, and in danger of Death, when your Life lies upon it, you would have the advice of an able Phyſitian, that is ſerious and afraid that he no way become guilty of your Death? Would you like that Phyſitian that ſeems to be unconcerned, and cares not whether you live or dy, if he might but have his fee? Or that ſhould merrily jeſt with you when you are ſick at Heart, and near to Death, if you be not cured? Would you take Pleaſure in his witty ſayings, and be jeſted into your Grave? Or if you go unto a Lawyer about your whole Eſtate, though it were in Leaſes that will expire, would you chooſe one, that you think did not care, whether you win or loſe your cauſe? Would you be pleaſed with ſome witty ſayings, impertinent to the pleading of your cauſe? Would you not ſay, Sir, I am in danger of loſing all I am worth, my Eſtate lyes at ſtake, deal plainly with me, and be ſerious in your undertaking for me, and tell me in words that I can underſtand the plain Law by which my caſe muſt be tryed. And will you be more careful about the Temporal Life of a Body that muſt dy? and about a Temporal Eſtate which you muſt leave when you dy? and not about your Soul that muſt ever live, and never dye? No! not ſo much as to ſet your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der faithful Preachers, that ſhall in words that you can underſtand, plainly tell you the Laws of Chriſt by which you muſt be tryed for your Life, and according to them be Eternally damned or ſaved?</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Such an Eyeing of Eternity would make you ſerious and lively in all your ſpiritual duties in all your approaches unto God:</hi> If you have no Grace, the ſerious thoughts of the unſeen Eternal World, would ſtir you up to beg and cry, and call for it; if you have to deſire more, and to exerciſe what you have; to confeſs your ſins with ſuch contrite bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken penitent hearts, as though you ſaw the fire burning, which by your ſins you have deſerved to be caſt into: To beg for Chriſt, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace, and pardoning Mercy with that lively Importunity, as if you ſaw the Lake of boiling Brimſtone, into which you muſt be caſt, if you be not ſanctifyed and pardoned; to hear the Word of God that ſets this Eternal World before you, with that diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as Men hearkning for their Lives; to commemorate the Death of Chriſt with ſuch life while you are at the Lords Supper,
<pb n="1005" facs="tcp:42587:337" rendition="simple:additions"/> while you do as it were ſee the Torments you are delivered from, and the Eternal Happineſs by Faith in a crucifyed Chriſt you have a Title to, it will cauſe a fire and flame of Love in your Hearts to that Lord that dyed for you, ardent deſires after him, complacential delight in him, thankfulneſs, hope of Heaven, hatred to ſin, reſolution to live to, or dye for him that dyed for you: If your Hearts are dead and dull, and out of frame, go and look into the unſeen Eternal World; take a believing view of Everlaſting Joyes and Torments on the other ſide of time, and you ſhall feel warmth and heat, and lively actings to be produced in you.</p>
            <p>Particularly this Eyeing of Eternity would make Miniſters ſenſible of the weightineſs of their work; that it calls for all poſſible diligence and care, our utmoſt ſerious ſtudy and endeavours, our fervent Cryes and Prayers to God for ability for the better management of our work, and for ſucceſs therein; for as much as our imployment is more Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately about Eternal matters: to ſave (under Chriſt) Eternal Souls from Eternal Torments, and to bring them to Eternal Joyes: When we are to Preach to people that muſt live for ever in Heaven, or Hell, with God, or Devils; and our very Preaching is the means appointed by God to fit men for an Everlaſting ſtate; when we ſtand and view ſome Hundreds of Perſons before us, and think, all theſe are going to Eternity; now we ſee them, and they ſee us, but after a little while they ſhall ſee us no more in our Pulpits, nor we them in their Pews; nor in any other place in this World, but we and they muſt go down unto the Grave, and into an Everlaſting World: when we think it may be ſome of theſe are hearing their laſt Sermon, making their laſt publique Prayers, keeping their laſt Sabbath, and before we come to Preach again, might be gone into another World; if we had but a firm belief of Eternity our ſelves, and a real lively ſenſe of the morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Bodies and our own, and the Immortality of the Souls of both, of the Eternity of the Joy or Torment we muſt all be quickly in, how pathetically ſhould we plead with them, plentifully weep over them, fervently pray for them, that our words, or rather the word of the Eternal God might have Effectual Operation on their Hearts? This Eyeing of Eternity ſhould</p>

You might eaſily ſee that Idleneſs either in young Students that are deſigned for this work, or in Miniſters actually engaged in it, is
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:42587:338" rendition="simple:additions"/> an intolerable ſin; and worſe in them than in any men under Heaven; Idleneſs in a Shop-keeper is a ſin, but much more in a Miniſter; in a Trader, much more in a Preacher; bear with me, if I tell you an Idle Cobler that is to mend mens Shooes is not to be approved, but an Idle Preacher that is to mend mens Hearts, and ſave their Souls ſhall be condemned by God and Men: for he lives in dayly diſobedience of that charge of God. 1 Tim. 4.13 —<hi>Give attendance to reading, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to doctrine.</hi> 15. <hi>Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi> 16—<hi>continue in them-</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>It would provoke us to be faithful in delivering the whole counſel of God, and not to daub with untempered mortar;</hi> not to flatter them in their ſin, or to be afraid to tell them of their evils, leaſt we ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them, or offend them: Is it time to ſooth men up in their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in their neglect of duty, when we ſee them at the very door of Eternity; on the very borders of an Everlaſting World, and this the fruit, that they ſhall dye in their ſins, and their Blood be required at our hands? Ezek. 33.1. to 10. but ſo to Preach and diſcharge the Miniſterial Function, that when dying, might be able to ſay as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.25. <hi>And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</hi> 26. <hi>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</hi> 27. <hi>For I have not ſhunned to declare to you all the counſel of God.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be plain in our ſpeech,</hi> that every capacity, of the weakeſt in the Congregation that hath an Eternal Soul that muſt be damned, or ſaved for ever, might underſtand in things neceſſary to Salvation, what we mean, and aim, and drive at; it hath made me tremble to hear ſome ſoar aloft, that knowing men might know their parts, while the meaner ſort are kept from the knowledge of Chriſt: and put their matter in ſuch a dreſs of words, in ſuch a ſtile ſo compoſed, that the moſt ſtand looking the Preacher in the face, and hear a ſound, but know not what he ſaith: and while he doth pretend to feed them, indeed doth ſtarve them; and to teach them, keepeth them in ignorance. Would a Man of any Bowels of compaſſion go from a Prince to a condemned man, and tell him in ſuch Language that he ſhould not underſtand, the conditions upon which the Prince would pardon him, and the poor man loſe his Life, becauſe the proud and haughty Meſſenger muſt ſhew his knack in delivering his meſſage in <hi>fine</hi> Engliſh, which the condemned Man could not underſtand; but this is <hi>courſe</hi> dealing with a Man in ſuch circumſtances that call for pity and compaſſion: <hi>Paul</hi> had more Parts, and Learning, but more ſelf-denyal than any of theſe, when he ſaid 1 Cor. 2.1. <hi>And I Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom, declaring to you the teſtimony of God.</hi> 4. <hi>And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with enticing Words of mans Wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.12. <hi>Seeing then we have ſuch hope, we uſe

            <p n="4">4. <hi>This Eyeing of Eternity would ſtir us up to improve our Intereſt in God and Men for a continual ſucceſſion of Men in the Miniſterial Function:</hi> In God, by Prayer, that the Lord of the Harveſt would ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt: In men, whether ſuch as have Children of pregnant parts, ſtudious and bookiſh, ſerious in Religion, and inclined to this Imployment, that they would give them to God, and give them Education in order to it, which would be the Honour of Parents to have ſuch proceed from their loins that ſhall be Embaſſadors to call the blind ungodly World to mind Eternity, to eſcape Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damnation, and obtain Eternal Life; or whether they be ſuch as have no Children ſo qualifyed, or diſpoſed, yet have riches to be helpful to ſuch as have ſuch Children, but not an Eſtate to bring them up; for there is a neceſſity of a ſtanding continued Miniſtry: Men in all Ages are haſting to Eternity; thoſe that were our Anceſtors in former Ages are already there, and have taken up their Lodgings where they muſt for ever dwell; and we are following after them; and what a mercy is it, that we have the Goſpel preached unto us, wherein we have directions how to eſcape Everlaſting Torments, and obtain Eternal Joyes in the other Eternal World to which we are a going; and thoſe that ſhall live after us, when they have been upon the ſtage of this World awhile, ſhall follow us and our Fathers into Eternity, and give place to thoſe that follow after them; thus this World doth often change its Inhabitants: What is the Life of Man, but a coming into time, and a going out into Eternity: Oh how needful is it then, that while they make their ſhort ſtay on Earth, they ſhould have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſters to warn them of Eternal Miſery, and teach them the way to Eternal Glory: Thoſe that are now engaged in the work, will ſhortly be all ſilenced by Death and Duſt: and how deſirable is it that your Children and poſterity ſhould ſee and hear others preaching in their room! and the Honourableneſs of the Office might allure young men to encline unto it: is it not an Honour to be an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the great Eternal God, to propound Articles of Everlaſting peace between him and Everlaſting Souls? What is buying and ſelling, Temporal, Tranſitory things in compariſon of a calling, wherein it is mens work and buſineſs to ſave Souls from Eternal Miſery, and to
<pb n="1008" facs="tcp:42587:339" rendition="simple:additions"/> bring them to the Eternal Enjoyment of the glorious God. Thus in ſome few particulars we have ſhewed the Influence that the Eyeing of Eternity will have upon us in what we do. Do you ſo Eye Eternity, and the reſt here for want of room omitted, you ſhall by experience find out, which will be better than knowing of them in the notion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are told you.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of this Diſcourſe ſhall be ſome particular uſes, omitting many that it would afford.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is there an Eternal State: Such unſeen Eternal Joyes and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Who then can <hi>ſufficiently lament</hi> the blindneſs, madneſs and folly of this diſtracted World, and the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe that have Rational and Eternal Souls to ſee them buſily imployed in the matters of time, which are only for time, in preſent Honours, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Profits, while they do neglect Everlaſting things? Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life and Death is before them, Everlaſting Joy or Torment is hard at hand, and yet poor ſinners take no care how to avoid the one, or obtain the other. Is it not matter of lamentation to ſee ſo many Thouſands bereaved of the ſober ſerious uſe of their Underſtandings? That while they uſe their reaſon to get the Riches of this World, they will not act as rational men to get the joyes of Heaven? and to avoid Temporal Calamities, yet not to eſcape Eternal miſery? Or if they be fallen into preſent Afflictions, they contrive how they may get out of them: if they be ſick, reaſon tells them they muſt uſe the means, if they would be well: if they be in pain, Nature puts them on to ſeek after a Remedy; and yet theſe ſame Men neglect all duty, and caſt away all care concerning Everlaſting matters: they are for ſeen pleaſures and profits which are paſſing from them in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, but the unſeen Eternal Glory in Heaven they pray not for, they think not of: Are they unjuſtly charged? Let Conſcience ſpeak, what thoughts they lye down withal upon their pillow; if they wake or ſleep, fly from them in the ſilent night, what a noiſe doth the cares of the World make in their Souls? With what thoughts do they riſe in the Morning? of God, or of the World? Of the things of time, or of Eternity? Their thoughts are in their Shops before they have been in Heaven; and many deſires after viſible Temporal gain; before they have had one deſire after the Inviſible, Eternal God, and Treaſures that are above. What do they do all the day long? What is it that hath their Endeavours all their labour and travel? Their moſt painful Induſtry, and unwearied diligence? Alas! their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will tell themſelves, and their practices tell others, when there is Trading, but no praying, Buying and Selling, but no Religious Duties performed: the ſhop-book is often opened, but the ſacred book of God is not looked into all the week long.</p>
            <p>O Lord! Forgive the hardneſs of my Heart, that I can ſee ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable folly among reaſonable Creatures, and can lament this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no more: Good Lord forgive the want of compaſſion in me, that
<pb n="1009" facs="tcp:42587:339" rendition="simple:additions"/> can ſtand and ſee this diſtraction in the World, as if the moſt of Men had loſt their wits, and were quite beſides themſelves, and yet my Bowels yearn no more towards immortal Souls that are going to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen miſeries in the Eternal World; to ſee diſtracted men buſie in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things that tend to no account is not ſuch an amazing ſight, as to ſee men that have reaſon for the World, to uſe it not for God, and Chriſt, and their own Eternal good: to ſee them love and embrace a preſent Dunghil World, and caſt away all ſerious, affecting, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual thoughts of the Life to come: to ſee them rage againſt the God of Heaven, and cry out againſt Holineſs, as fooliſh preciſeneſs, and ſerious Godlineſs, as Madneſs, and Melancholy.</p>
            <p>Alas! Theſe Men are Brutes in the ſhape of Men; for like the very Beaſts they live by ſenſe, and are led away by a ſenſitive appetite: The Brute takes pleaſure in his preſent Provender, and feels the ſmart of the preſent Spur, or Goad, and ſo do ſenſual Sinners find ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their preſent pleaſures, and profits, and do complain of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain and ſickneſs; but of pains to come, and joyes to come that are Eternal, they have no care, nor ſerious thoughts. Better ſuch had been Toads and Serpents, than rational Creatures; for as they mind no future things in the other World, ſo they are not Subjects capable of Eternal Puniſhment, or Everlaſting Happineſs; they are not ſo provident as the Ant, that in Summer lays up for Winter, and while the warm Sun doth ſhine, provides for a cold and ſtormy day: but Men that have Immortal Souls are only for this preſent World, but do not provide for a ſtormy day that is a coming, nor for an Eternal ſtate to which they are haſting.</p>
            <p>Let us call the whole Creation of God to lament and bewail the folly of Man that was made the beſt of all Gods viſible works; but now by ſuch wickedneſs is bad beyond them all, being made by God for an Everlaſting ſtate, and yet minds nothing leſs than that for which he was principally made.</p>
            <p>O Sun! Why is it not thy burden to give light to men to do thoſe works, and walk in thoſe wayes that bring them to Eternal Darkneſs? O Earth! Why doſt thou not groan to bear ſuch burdenſome Fooles that dig into thy Bowels for Gold and Silver, while they do neglect Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Treaſures in the Eternal World? O ye Sheep and Oxen! Fiſh and Fowl! Why do ye not cry out againſt them that take away your preſent Life to maintain them in being, but only mind preſent things, but forget the Eternal God that gave them Dominion over you, to live upon you while they had time to mind Eternal things, but do not? O ye Angels of God, and Bleſſed Saints in Heaven, were ye capable of grief and ſorrow, would not ye bitterly lament the ſin and folly of poor mortals upon Earth? Could ye look down from that Bleſſed place where ye do dwell, and behold the Joy and Glory which is to us unſeen, and ſee how it is baſely ſlighted by the Sons of Men, if ye were not above ſorrow and mourning, would not ye take this up for a bitter lamentation? O ye Saints on Earth! whoſe Eyes are open to ſee what
<pb n="1010" facs="tcp:42587:340" rendition="simple:additions"/> the blind deluded World doth not ſee, do ye bitterly take on, let your Heads be Fountains of Water, and your Eyes ſend forth Rivers of Tears for the great neglect of Eternal Joyes and Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Can you ſee Men going out of time into Eternity in their Sin, and in their Blood, in their Guilt, and Unconverted ſtate, and your Hearts not moved? your Bowels not yearn? Have ye ſpent all your tears in bewailing your own ſin, that your Eyes are dry when ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch monſtrous madneſs, and unparallel folly of ſo many, with whom dayly ye converſe? Ye ſanctifyed Parents, have ye no pity for your ungodly Children? nor ſanctifyed Children for ungodly Parents? O my Father, my Father, by whom I had my Being, is going to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Darkneſs! Alas for my Mother, my dear Mother, that carryed me in her womb, that dandled me upon her knees, that ſuckled me at her breaſts, that did delight to break her ſleep to quiet me when I was froward, to look to me when I was ſick, that bound my head when it was pained, that wiped mine eyes when I did weep, and my face when I did ſweat; becauſe of my Diſeaſe, this my Mother is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of her own Immortal Soul; was more troubled for me when ſhe thought I was near my Grave, than for her ſelf, though near to Hell: when I was young, ſhe took care for me, for things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but for her ſelf neither young nor old, for things Eternal. Ere long ſhe will be dead, and I am afraid, and damned too: Ere long ſhe muſt go out of time, and for any thing I can perceive, being Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and fearleſs of God, and unmindful of Eternity, her Soul will go into Eternity of Torments. O how loath am I to have ſuch thoughts of one ſo near, ſo dear unto me? Oh it is the cutting of my Heart, it is bitterneſs to my Soul. I had rather dye, than ſhe be damned; and yet it is my feares, ſhe is haſting to Eternity of Wo; for to my obſerving Eye ſhe is taken wholly up with the cares, and pride, and vanity of this Life, and apparently regardleſs of that Eternal World.</p>
            <p>Why do not alſo ye that are Parents, that have a belief of an Everlaſting State, take on, and bewail the doleful ſtate of your ungodly Children, that in their ſinful courſes are poſting to Eternal pains. What my Son! the Son of my Loins! the Son of my Womb! Did I bear him with ſo much ſorrow, and ſhall he be a caſtaway? Did I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him with ſo much pain, and brought and nurſed him up with ſo much labour, and muſt he be for ever fuel for the Flames of Hell? Have I brought forth a Child to be a prey to Devils, and a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them to all Eternity? Oh my Son, my Son, what ſhall I do for thee my Son, my Son. Thus whatever Relation, Neighbour, Friend, or Acquaintance you have, or others that you ſee go on in ſin, let it be your grief, trouble, lamentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when there is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Joyes, and they will loſe it, an Eternity of Torments, and they be caſt into it.</p>

            <p>Uſe II. <hi>Do ſomething every day in preparing for an Eternal ſtate.</hi> If any thing of weight lyeth upon your hands, this is it. If I could prevail with you in any thing; Oh that it might be in this! if in any thing I am to preach, I had need to have gone unto my knees, to beg that my meſſage might be regarded, this is it: If in any thing I ſhould be ſerious in Preaching, and you in Hearing, ſtill this it: The longer your abode ſhall be, the greater preparation you ſhould make; When we exhort you to prepare for other Duties, it is but in order unto this, that you might be prepared for the Eternal World: When we exhort you to Repent, Believe, be Holy, or prepare for Death, in all, we have an Eye unto Eternity: But if my words be ſlighted and rejected by you, will you do ſo by the word of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God himſelf, that hath given you this in charge? If I ſhew you expreſs commands from God, that will ſhortly take you into Heaven, or judge you down to Hell; that will quickly call you out of time into Eternity, will you promiſe you will do it then? then read, and do what you ſhall read. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20, 33. <hi>Luc.</hi> 13.24. <hi>John</hi> 6.27. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. To theſe Scriptures I will add theſe following Arguments to perſwade you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath ſet you in this World for this very work to make ready for Eternity.</hi> Conſider I beſeech you, and demand an anſwer of your ſelves, Why hath God brought you out of Nothing, and given you a Being more noble than all his viſible works, in making your Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, induing you with Reaſon and Underſtanding? Do you think it was that you ſhould look after, Riches, and not Grace? things Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, not Eternal? to buy and ſell, and eat and drink, and ſleep? Do you in your Conſcience think that God hath appointed you no higher things to mind, no more laſting things to get? Reaſon will convince you, and Conſcience will prove it to your face, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of your own Souls conſidered, doth undeniably argue that God hath made you for more noble Ends, higher Imployments, and greater Concerns. Why then do you not mind the end of your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do the work that God hath ſet you in time to do, and look after that Eternal ſtate that God hath made you for? I have read of a devout <hi>Pilgrim</hi> travelling to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in his way paſſed through many Cities, where he ſaw many ſtately Buildings, rare Monuments, and delightful things, but he was wont to ſay, but this is not <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this is not the end of my coming hither: I am ſure that you are Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, but whether devout or no, let Conſcience ſpeak: and you ſhould be travelling to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and if not, you are to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments, why then do you ſtand gazing at the Temporal things you ſee in your Journey, and your Hearts and Eyes ſo taken with them? <hi>Sirs,</hi> this is not the Heavenly Jeruſalem, this is not the end of your coming hither, be ſure the minding, loving, looking after things of time in the neglect of God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, is not preparing
<pb n="1012" facs="tcp:42587:341" rendition="simple:additions"/> for Eternity, except it be for an Eternity of Wo, and Miſery, and what need you be at ſo much pains and labour to get thither?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth give you your time in this World to prepare for Eternity.</hi> You have time to repent, to get an Intereſt in Chriſt, to mortifie ſin, to pray for Grace, to make your peace with God, to get the pardon of your ſins, and all this that you might be fitted for Eternity. Why then do not you do in time that which God hath given you time for; Can you imagine that God doth lengthen out ſo long the day of his Patience, only that you might labour for Temporal Riches? Or that you ſhould live a life of Carnal Pleaſure, or gratifie the Fleſh? Can it enter into your heads that God ſupporteth you in Being, and keeps you yet out of the Grave and Hell, that you might ſcrape together things Temporal, and neglect the things that are Eternal. Doth he make his Sun to riſe upon you every Morning, to give you light to drudge for things that are but for a moment, and let alone the things that are for ever? And if God hath given you time in order to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, why do you ſpend your time in getting things that are but for a time, and not for Eternity? Oh the years that you have had! the Moneths, the Weeks that God hath given you to be improved for Eternity, and you ſpend it, ſome in things abſolutely ſinful in ſerving of the Devil, and your Luſts; ſome in things in themſelves lawful, but unlawfully, but none in the things abſolutely neceſſary that you may be happy in Eternity: ſome in taking of your carnal Pleaſures, ſome in Trading, ſome in Every thing but the One thing needful, that none is left for an Everlaſting ſtate; but when you ſhall be in Eternity, you will repent, though then too late, that in this World, you ſo ſpent your time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As you go out of time, ſo you muſt in the ſame ſtate go into Eternity.</hi> If you dye in your ſin, you muſt in your ſin go down to Hell. This is a Life of Tryal, here in time you are Probationers for Eternity, and as you are found at the end of time, ſo your ſtate ſhall be determined to Eternity of Happineſs, or Miſery without end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>You ſtand upon the brink of Time,</hi> you are near the Borders of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo near, that you that are in Time to day, might be in Eternity to morrow, or ſooner; for you never yet ſaw that hour, that you could ſay, you are ſure of the next: when you have drawn one breath, you are not ſure to draw another. Time is ſhort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. ſet forth ſometimes by years, if Seventy, how much is already paſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. Sometimes by Moneths, <hi>Job</hi> 14.5. by dayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. by one day, <hi>Job</hi> 14.6. by a ſpan, and nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. by a vapour; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14, 15. But what if you were to live a Thouſand years in pleaſure upon Earth, and after that paſs into Eternity of pain and torment; would you not when there, cry out of your own folly that you ſhould purchaſe a Thouſand years of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="1013" facs="tcp:42587:341" rendition="simple:additions"/> at ſo dear a rate, as to endure for them Everlaſting Burnings? One would think you ſhould not get it out of your heads that you are almoſt in Eternity. One would think you ſhould think on this when you lye down, and when you do riſe up, or dream of this in your ſleep, that you are as near to Heaven or Hell, to an Eternity of Joy, or Miſery, as to your Grave.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>When time is paſt and gone, and you are entred into Eternity, it will be too late to prepare for it.</hi> Preparation for Eternity muſt be done in time, not in Eternity. Now, or Never, if once Death ſtop your Mouth, and cloſe your Eyes, dying in your ſin, you muſt bid farewel to God and Chriſt for ever. When time is gone, your hope and all is gone. When time is gone, it will never come again: Yeſterday you ſhall never ſee more; and the time that is going while I ſpeak and you hear; when gone will never come, that which is to come, will be preſent, but not that which is paſt. If you loſe your Health, you might recover it again; if your Eſtate, you might get it again; but if you loſe your time, it is gone for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>If you go out of time unfitted for Eternity, better you had never been in time.</hi> Better for you, if you had been alwaies nothing: Or if a Being, to have been a Dog, a Toad, or Serpent; for theſe do live in time, but after time they do not live in Eternal Miſery, as they are not capable of Eternal Happineſs; and when you lye in extremity, and eternity of pains in Hell, this will be your judgment, that it had been better never to have been, then to be for ever miſerable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Multitudes have, and more ſhall come ſhort of Eternal Happineſs, and go do down to Everlaſting Miſery,</hi> and yet doth it not concern us to be preparing for Eternity? What means this ſottiſhneſs of mind, that when multitudes are going dayly out of time into Eternity, from ſeen pleaſures, to unſeen pains, that we are thus ſecure and careleſs, as if we ſhould live ſo long in time, as never to live in Eternity? Or that our Being ſhould end with time? Have not we deſerved Eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as well as they that in Eternity are now enduring of it? and do you know you have deſerved it, and take no care to prevent it; not ſo much as ask of God by ſerious Prayers and Tears, that you might not be caſt into Everlaſting burnings? Do you think you can make as light of the wrath of God, when you ſhall feel it in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as you do when you hear of it in time? Can you be merry in the flames of Hell? Can you jeſt, and ſport, and play, when you ſhall be filled with the Indignation of a provoked God, or when the Arrows of the Almighty ſhall ſtiick ſo faſt, as never to be plucked from you? Why then do you in time cry out and roar, and bitterly complain under the ſmarting pain that the Gout, or Stone. or Cholick puts you to? why do you ſay if this were to continue for one year, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion or mitigation, you had rather dye than live? Do
<pb n="1014" facs="tcp:42587:342" rendition="simple:additions"/> not many walk in the broad way that leads to Eternal Damnation? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14. Are not the Holy, Humble, Penitent ones ſaved with much difficulty? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. Are not many Profeſſors gone to Hell? <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. and Preachers too? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23. and yet is it not time for you in good earneſt to mind your Eternal ſtate, leſt there being an Everlaſting Kingdom, you ſhould never enter into it, and Everlaſting Torments, and you ſhould feel them to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>God doth give you all the helps and means you have, that you ſhould make ready for Eternity.</hi> Have not you had Sermons and Sabbaths? Have not Gods Miniſters preached to you, and warned you from God of the wrath to come, and charged you in the Name of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, and turn, and told you, you muſt turn from ſin, or burn in Hell? And will you go from hearing on Earth, to howlings in Hell? from the Light of the Goſpel to utter Darkneſs? with the ſound of the voice of Mercy in your Ears? After a thouſand calls to mind your Souls, to accept of Chriſt, and remedying Grace? Do you mean to have the hotteſt place in that Infernal Lake? the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt load of Wrath in that Eternal Furnace? Read, and tremble when you read. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.20, to 25.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>This will be approved Wiſdom ere long by all the Sons of Men:</hi> Thoſe that now do mock at Praying, and make a mock of Sinning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride ſerious Godlineſs, ſhall quickly be of another mind; ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and know that they were the wiſeſt Men, that in time prepared for Eternity, and they were the Fools that ſpent their time in Sin and Vanity. Some do ſay as much when they lye a dying, and wiſh, oh that I had been convinced of this before my time had been ſo near an end! before my glaſs had been ſo nigh out! Oh my Folly! Oh my Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! that had Eternity to make preparation for, and yet of all the time I had, I never ſpent one hour in hearty Prayer unto God to ſave me from Everlaſting Torments. Wo is me! my ſtrength is almoſt gone, my time is almoſt gone, and I in danger of Eternal Torments, that never ſhall be paſt and gone! or if they be blind or hardned on their Death-beds, yet a moment after Death they ſhall be convinced indeed, that it was worſe than madneſs to neglect Eternity. When ſtept into the other World, ſhall be amazed and confounded, ſaying, where am I now? what a place is this? what a ſtate is this? I heard of ſuch a place before, but it is worſe than any Mans Tongue in time could tell. What is time gone! this is not time. Here is no Sun to meaſure it by its motion; here is no ſucceſſion of Night and Day. Here is no turning of an Hour-glaſs, no ſtriking or telling of Clocks; No Morning, Noon, and Evening: this is not time. I ſee nothing like the things I ſaw in time. But a little while ago, I was among my Friends on Earth: Did I ſay a little while ago? Alas, I am but lately come, and this little while ſeems to me a Thouſand years: No
<pb n="1015" facs="tcp:42587:342" rendition="simple:additions"/> while in this place is little, and it will never be leſs, becauſe it doth not go. Oh happy they that are in Eternity, but in another place than I am in! they were wiſe indeed that have prevented their coming hither, and are got into a place that is as light as this is dark: as joyful, as this is ſorrowful: as full of eaſe, as this is of pain: and yet this muſt laſt as long as that, and that makes this as bitter and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as that is pleaſant and delightful. Wiſe were they that did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee while they were in time, but I like a blind Fool did not ſee before I felt what I muſt endure for ever. I did not ſee, but Death did draw the Curtain, open the Door, and let me in to an Everlaſting State; but wo is me! it is of Miſery and Damnation. You are for being of the mind of the moſt, and doing that which the Generality do approve; take in but theſe words, <hi>firſt, or laſt,</hi> and then do ſo: even that which all firſt or laſt ſhall confeſs to be trueſt wiſdom; and the neglect of it, folly and madneſs. God, Angels, good Men do all approve of this as ſober Wiſdom; and the Devils cannot deny it, and all Damned Souls in Hell, and all the Wicked upon Earth as faſt as they go down to them, and feel what now they do not believe and fear, ſhall not deny it, to be Wiſdom in them that eſcaped that, and got to a better place in the Eternal World.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>In Eternity there will be no mixture.</hi> In the other World there is all pure Love, or all pure Wrath; all Sweet, or all Bitter; without all Pain, or without all Eaſe; without all Miſery, or without all Happineſs: not partly at Eaſe, and partly in Pain, partly Happy, and partly Miſerable, but all the one, or the other. This Life is a middle place betwixt Heaven and Hell, and here we partake of ſome good, and ſome Evil: No Judgment on this ſide Hell upon the worſt of Men, but there is ſome Mercy mixed with it, for it is Mercy they are yet on this ſide Hell; and no Condition on this ſide Heaven, but there is ſome Evil mixed with it, for till we get to Heaven, we ſhall have ſin in us. In Heaven all are good, in Hell all are bad; on Earth ſome good, but more bad. In Hell Miſery, without mixture of Mercy, or of Hope; they have no Mercy, and that is bad; and they can hope for none, and that is worſe; while they be in time, they are pityed; God doth pity them, and Chriſt doth pity them, and good Men doth pity them, their Friends and Relations do pity them, pray for them, and weep over them: but when time is paſt, all pity will be paſt, and they in Miſery without pity to all Eternity. Rev. 14.10. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation: and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb.</hi> 11. <hi>and the ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt, day nor night</hi>— No! then for the Lords ſake, for your Souls ſake, as upon my knees I beſeech you, if you have any dread of God, any fear of Hell, any deſire of Heaven, any care whither you muſt go, take no reſt night nor day in time, till you have ſecured your Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="1016" facs="tcp:42587:343" rendition="simple:additions"/> happy ſtate, that you might have Everlaſting reſt, night and Day in Eternity; or that you might paſs into that Eternity where it is alwayes day and no night; and not into that, where it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies night and never day. Sirs! what ſay ye? What are ye reſolved upon? to ſin ſtill, or to repent that ye have already ſinned, and by the Grace of God to ſin ſo no more? To work in time, for things of time, or in time to prepare for Eternity? Will ye obey my meſſage, or will ye not? Speak in time, or I will not ſay, hold your peace for ever, but repent in time, or ye ſhall cry and roar for ever. The time of this Sermon is out, and the time of your Life will be quickly out, and I am afraid I ſhall leave ſome of you as unfit for Eternity as I found you: and my heart doth tremble, leaſt Death ſhould find you, as I ſhall leave you, and the Juſtice of God, and the Devils of Hell ſhould find you as Death ſhall leave you, and then vengeance ſhall never leave you, and the Burning Flames, Tormenting Devils, and the Gnawing Worm ſhall never leave you. Will ye then work it upon your Hearts that ye came into Time, unfit to go into Eternity: that in time ye have made your ſelves more unfit: that the only remedy is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that in the fulneſs of time did dye, that Sinners might not be damned for ever; that this Crucifyed Chriſt will not ſave you from Eternal Miſery, nor take you to Eternal Glory, except ye do perform the Conditions of the Goſpel, without which, his Death puts no Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an actual ſtate of Happineſs; ye <hi>muſt Repent</hi> and be Converted, ye <hi>muſt take</hi> him for your Saviour, and your Lord; ye <hi>muſt be</hi> Holy ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Hate Sin univerſally, love Chriſt ſuperlatively, or elſe the Saviour will not ſave you; Mercy it ſelf will not ſave you from Everlaſting Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Ye <hi>muſt perſevere</hi> in all this to the end of your time, and then ye ſhall be Happy in Eternity, to Eternity. Otherwiſe ye ſhall not give audience <hi>Sirs,</hi> otherwiſe ye ſhall not be Happy. Happy! no ye ſhall be Miſerable. If the loſs of God and Chriſt, and Heaven will make you Miſerable for ever, ye ſhall be Miſerable for ever: If the pains of Hell, the company of Devils, the ſtingings of Conſcience, the terrors of Darkneſs, total, final, deſpair of having any end of your damned condition will make you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, ye ſhall be miſerable. If all that God can lay upon you, if all that Devils can torment you with, if all that Conſcience can for ever accuſe you for; if all that is in Hell can make you miſerable, except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in time, and believe on Chriſt in time, and be ſanctifyed in time, ye ſhall be miſerable for ever. O my God! be thou my Witneſs of this Doctrine. All ye that fear God, that hear me this day, bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that I have publiſhed this in the Ears of all that hear me. Thou Conſcience, that art in that Man, that is yet going on in Sin, and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſpeed to Eternal Miſery, bear me witneſs now, and at the day of Judgment, that I told him what muſt be done upon him, in him, and by him, if he would eſcape Eternal Torments. If he will not hearken nor obey while he is in time; Conſcience, I beſpeak thy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him, and that thou bring thy Accuſation againſt him, and upbraid him to the Confuſion of his face, among all the Devils in
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:42587:343" rendition="simple:additions"/> Hell, and all that ſhall be damned with him, that he was told he could not keep his ſins, and be kept out of that place when he dyed; he could not reject Chriſt, and finally refuſe him, and be ſaved for ever. Sinner! careſt thou not? wilt thou ſtill on? Good God! muſt we end thus? Muſt I come down without hopes of his Repenting; and he dye with fooliſh hopes of being ſaved, and after Death be caſt into that Eternity where the Worm dyeth not, and the Fire is not quenched? But in thoſe Endleſs Flames ſhall cry out and roar, oh curſed Caitif! what did I mean all the while I was in time, to neglect preparation for Eternity? Oh miſerable Wretch! this is a doleful, dreadful ſtate, and ſtill the more, becauſe it is Eternal. Wo is me! that I cannot dye, nor ceaſe to be! Oh that God would cut me off! Oh that Devils could tear me into a Thouſand, Thouſand pieces; or that I could uſe ſuch violence to my ſelf, that I might be no longer what I am, nor where I am! But alas! I wiſh in vain, and all theſe deſires are in vain; for though the union of my Soul and Body in my Mothers Womb was lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a diſſolution; yet ſince this Body did ariſe out of the Boſom of the Earth, and is reunited to its Soul, admits of no ſeparation for ever; and which ſtill is worſe, this Soul and Body now ſeparated from God and Chriſt, and all that be above in that Bleſſed Eternity, muſt Never, Never be admitted near unto them. Oh curſed be the day that ever I was born! Curſed be that folly and madneſs that brought me to this curſed place! for here I lye under extremity of pain, which if it were for an year or two, or many Millions, and then end, would be in this reſpect exceeding heavy, becauſe it were to laſt ſo long, but that then ſhould be no longer, would make it in the mean while to be the lighter: but when <hi>Eternity</hi> is added to <hi>Extremity,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added to make me extremely, becauſe in this extremity I am eternally miſerable. Oh <hi>Eternity! Eternity!</hi> in my condition what is more dreadful than Eternity? This Fire burns to all Eternity; the heavy ſtroaks of revenging Juſtice will be laid on me to all Eternity; I am baniſhed from God and Happineſs to all Eternity. <hi>Oh Eternity! Eternity!</hi> nothing cuts me to the heart, like the corroding thoughts of this Eternity. I am an Object of the Wrath of God, of the contempt of Angels, of the deriſion of Saints, of the mockings of Devils, and curſed Fiends to all Eternity: I burn, but cannot be conſumed; I toſs and rowl, and cannot reſt to all Eternity. <hi>Oh Eternity! Eternity!</hi> thou art enough to break my heart, and make it dye, but that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not break, nor dye to all Eternity. And if this ſhall be the doleful Language, the direful Lamentations of Souls that went Chriſtleſs out of time into Eternity, do ye while ye are in time Eye Eternity in all you do, and get a Title to Eternal Happineſs, or elſe when ye are in Eternity, ye ſhall remember that in time ye were fore-warned, which warning becauſe ye did not take, ſhall be a vexation to your Hearts to all Eternity.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Subject</hi> I am to treat upon is <hi>Communion with God,</hi> how to <hi>attain it,</hi> and how to <hi>maintain it,</hi> in as conſtant a courſe as we may be capable of in this World: And for that end I have choſen this Text. My uſual courſe is to provide matter for a Text, but in this Lecture I provide a Text for the matter I am to treat upon; The Subject is high and copious, much ſpoken of, but I fear not ſo well underſtood, and leſs experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; though the Subject mainly relates to Chriſtian Experience. Before I come to the Subject, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of the Text upon which it is grounded.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Epiſtle is St. <hi>John, John</hi> the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> as he was anciently called; and he writes this Epiſtle, (ſome think) to the Believing <hi>Jews</hi> only, others think rather to the whole <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and the matter of the Epiſtle is partly to diſtinguiſh the true and the falſe Chriſtian, and for that end layes down many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Characters to diſtinguiſh, and partly to vindicate the Doctrine of the Goſpel concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the true Meſſiah,</hi> his Perſon, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:42587:345" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Salvation by him alone, from the many errors that were crept in by falſe Teachers and Seducers in his time; as <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion,</hi> &amp;c. as he intimates in the 1 John 2.26. <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak concerning them that ſeduce you.</hi> He alſo vindicates the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the Chriſtian Profeſſion from the impure practices of the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> and the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> who began early to abuſe the true liberty of the Goſpel, and to turn the <hi>Grace of God</hi> into <hi>wantonneſs.</hi> And laſtly he doth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs them to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Love of one another, becauſe of the Perſecutions he ſaw were coming upon the Church from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the diviſions that would ariſe amongſt themſelves from many falſe Brethren.</p>
            <p>And hereupon to ſtrengthen their Faith and Profeſſion the more, he ſhews forth the Goſpel in the beginning of this Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, <hi>That which was from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it: as in the third verſe, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, and our hands have handled of the word of Life, declare we unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the main <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it; <hi>Theſe things have we written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that ye may have Fellowſhip with us:</hi> with us the true Apoſtles of Chriſt, and not go out from us; as he complains of ſome that did in this Epiſtle: <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us:</hi> And then tells them what their Fellowſhip was, <hi>Truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that he propoſeth Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, and with Jeſus Chriſt, as the great ſcope and end of the Goſpel; and he mentioneth Chriſt as well as God, becauſe all our Fellowſhip with God is by Jeſus Chriſt. So that the Apoſtle doth invite and perſwade the believing <hi>Jews</hi> to Fellowſhip with himſelf and other Apoſtles in the Doctrine and Ordinances of the Goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them; or more generally the whole Catholick Church of God, conſiſting both of believing <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> but all this was in order to their having Fellowſhip with God, and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſhews the way how to have this Fellowſhip with God; which he ſetteth down both Negatively, and Affirmatively.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively in the ſixth verſe, <hi>If we ſay that we have Fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively in the words of the Text? <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the Apoſtle proves by an Argument taken from the Nature of God in the fifth verſe, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all;</hi> and therefore they that would have Fellowſhip with him who is Light, muſt walk in the Light; for what <hi>Communion hath light with darkneſs.</hi> But by <hi>Light</hi> is not meant any viſible, material Light, either Natural or Artificial, but a <hi>Light</hi> that is <hi>Divine,</hi> Spiritual, and Intellectual; For
<pb n="1021" facs="tcp:42587:345" rendition="simple:additions"/> though God expreſſeth himſelf to us by things Natural, when he is call'd Light, or Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he is <hi>Ens tranſcendens, a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being;</hi> and it is a true rule, nothing can be predicated <hi>univocally</hi> of God and the Creature; And he doth not ſay only of God <hi>that he is in the Light,</hi> as verſe the ſeventh, Or that he dwelleth in the Light, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere expreſſeth it, But <hi>He is Light.</hi> Light Eſſentially, Originally, Eternally; Light it ſelf, and in him he ſaith <hi>there is no darkneſs at all;</hi> He is a pure, ſimple, immixt, and perfect Light: As we ſay of that which is perfect, it is <hi>plenum ſui, full of it ſelf,</hi> without any mixture of the contrary.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is God called Light without Darkneſs? And what is this Light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Knowledge</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> are <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> So that when he ſaith that God is <hi>Light,</hi> he means that <hi>God is Wiſdom,</hi> without mixture of <hi>Folly, Knowledge</hi> without <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Neſcience, Truth</hi> without any <hi>Error,</hi> or any <hi>falſe Conceptions</hi> in his Eternal Mind; and <hi>Holineſs</hi> without the leaſt mixture of <hi>Sin;</hi> ſo that the way to have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, is to <hi>walk in the Light,</hi> that is to ſay, to walk in Wiſdom, and not as Fools; to walk according to <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and not in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> to walk in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and not in <hi>Errour,</hi> to walk in the way of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and not of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi> Now <hi>Light</hi> in men, it is either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Supernatural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Natural, which is either the Light of the Body, which is the Eye, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. Or</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Light of the Soul, which is the Light of Reaſon, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience; this we are to walk in according to the utmoſt Sphere and extent thereof: But <hi>Supernatural Light,</hi> that ſhines from Supernatural Revelation in the Scriptures, and the inlightning Spirit of God in the Souls of Men, is the Light here meant in the Text, and which Chriſtians ſhould walk in. Now this is the way to have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with God, as the Text ſaith, <hi>If we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now by one with another</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Some ſay the Apoſtle means the <hi>Saints</hi> to whom he writes, we and ye ſhall have Fellowſhip together, we Apoſtles, and ye Believers. And the Vulgar Latine carries it that way, and renders it <hi>ad invicem;</hi> But we muſt rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Fellowſhip that God hath with his People, and they with him. And ſo <hi>Beza</hi> underſtands it, <hi>mutuam habemus cum eo communionem.</hi> An Ancient <hi>Greek Manuſcript</hi> hath in the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with him, that is, <hi>God and we ſhall have Fellowſhip with one another.</hi> And the rather we are to underſtand it in
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:42587:346" rendition="simple:additions"/> this ſenſe; for the Apoſtle he is not ſpeaking here of the Communion which the Saints have with one another, but of our Communion and Fellowſhip with God, as in the ſixth verſe, <hi>If we ſay we have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth:</hi> And then he adds, <hi>but if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſpeak to the Subject it ſelf, and herein ſhall diſcourſe of theſe four Generals.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What this <hi>Communion with God</hi> is.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Give ſome <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> about it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Shew how it is to be <hi>Attained</hi> and <hi>Maintained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Deduce ſome <hi>Conſequences</hi> that follow from my whole Diſcourſe concerning it; And then conclude with ſome practical Application.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">General. </seg>I</label> I. What this <hi>Communion with God is,</hi> The Word in the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>common;</hi> and ſo it imports ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is common and mutual betwixt God and us, as Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among men imports ſomething mutual on each ſide, ſo that our Communion with God, it is either <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive: Active,</hi> in what paſſeth from us to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> in what is Communicated from him to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Active</hi> on our part, which conſiſteth in the Divine Operations of our Souls towards God, when the faculties of the Soul are tending towards him, and terminated upon him; when the <hi>Mind</hi> is exerciſed in the contemplation of him, the <hi>Will</hi> in chuſing and embracing him, when the <hi>Affections</hi> are fixt upon him, and Center in him, when by our <hi>Deſires</hi> we purſue after him, by our <hi>Love</hi> we cleave to him, and by <hi>Delight</hi> we acquieſce and ſolace our ſelves in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Paſſive</hi> on Gods part, and ſo our Communion with God conſiſts in our participation of him, and in his communicating himſelf to us; and this Communication of God to us in our Communion with him, is ſpecially in theſe three things, <hi>Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In <hi>Light,</hi> I mean the Light of Spiritual Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereby we are inabled to diſcern Spiritual things Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; This is called <hi>Gods ſhining into our Hearts</hi> by the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>and ſeeing Light in Gods Light</hi> by the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In <hi>Life,</hi> whereby we are made partakers of the Life of God, though in a lower degree, and are no longer <hi>alienated from the Life of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle declared the Gentiles to be: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And by this Life of God we muſt underſtand, that which the Scripture calls San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, For Holyneſs is the Life of God in Man: For when God Sanctifies a Man, he quickens the Soul that was dead in Sin, and makes it partake of the Divine Life, or the Life of God; and which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is called a partaking of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and a <hi>renewing Man into the Image of God,</hi> Col. 3.10.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="1023" facs="tcp:42587:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>(3.) In <hi>Love;</hi> God communicates his Love alſo in the ſenſe and taſt of it to the Soul, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>The ſhedding abroad the Love of God in the Heart.</hi> Rom. 5. So that in this Communion with God, we have not only the Theory of his Love in our minds, but ſome <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of it in our Hearts: And under this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all that <hi>Peace, Joy</hi> and <hi>Conſolation</hi> that ſprings out of this to the Soul, and ariſing from the Communication of the ſence of his Love to us. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth this Communion with God in both the parts of it; <hi>James</hi> 4.8. when he ſaith, <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> And Chriſt expreſſeth them both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in theſe words, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi> He expreſſeth the active part of Communion with God by our loving him, and keeping his Commandements; and the paſſive part, by his own, and his Fathers coming to us to make their abode with us; The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth them by our <hi>dwelling in God,</hi> and <hi>Gods dwelling in us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. We dwell in God either by Faith in him, whereby we make him the Object of our Truſt, Confidence and dependance; or eſpecially by our Love to him, as he there expreſſeth it, <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God;</hi> And then Gods dwelling in us is Communion with God in the other part of it, conſiſting in a Communication of himſelf to us.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Communion</hi> with God we muſt think ſoberly of it: It is not a transformation of the Soul of Man, into the Divine Eſſence and Being, as if Man was made God, ſwallowed up into him, and loſt his own Exiſtence and Being in God; Neither is it a mixture of Gods Being, with the Being of the Creature, as Water and Wine are mingled together, ſo that the Nature of them both is loſt in that mixture. For it is not thus with <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, or the <hi>Glorifyed Spirits</hi> there, for they ſtill retain their own diſtinct Nature and Being, though, they are in the Higheſt <hi>Communion</hi> with God. Neither is it thus between the Humane and the Divine Nature of Chriſt, as if theſe two were mingled together, and did loſe their proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Natures, in each other, though the <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Divine Nature of Chriſt</hi> have a moſt near Union and Communion with each other.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Communion</hi> it is <hi>a Sacred</hi> and <hi>Mutual Intercourſe</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his People, whereby they go forth and act in the Divine exerciſe of their faculties towards him, and he comes forth in the Communication of himſelf <hi>in Light, Life,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I next proceed to ſpeak of ſome <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> about Communion <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">General. </seg>II</label> with God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Communion with God may be conſidered either with reſpect to this World, or the World to come; the one is <hi>Imperfect,</hi> the other is perfect, one is <hi>Mediate,</hi> the other <hi>Immediate;</hi> the one is <hi>Inconſtant,</hi> and often <hi>interrupted;</hi> the other is <hi>conſtant, fixed,</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> without any <hi>Interruption</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="1024" facs="tcp:42587:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>(2.) This Communion with God hath higher and lower degrees both in the <hi>Nether</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper World;</hi> Both among the Saints here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Saints and Angels above: As there are Orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, and ſome nearer to the Throne of God than others; and receive higher Communications of God to them, ſo it is with the Saints made perfect in that Heavenly State.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) This Communion with God is either <hi>Internal,</hi> or <hi>External;</hi> By <hi>Internal</hi> I mean that ſacred Intercourſe between God and the Soul, which is managed only in the inward Man; And by <hi>External,</hi> I mean this Communion with God managed in ſome External Ordinance of his Worſhip in the Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">General. </seg>III</label> III. I next proceed to ſhew how this Communion with God is <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> and then <hi>maintained.</hi> I anſwer in General, It is attained only in that way which God himſelf hath appointed thereunto. The <hi>Heathen</hi> did aim at having Fellowſhip with their Gods, and therefore they built them <hi>Temples</hi> to dwell in, Erected <hi>Oracles</hi> for them to ſpeak to them by, and they built <hi>Altars</hi> to ſacrifice to them, and appointed <hi>Prieſts</hi> to be their <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Miniſters of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between them and their Gods, they uſed ſeveral Charms to bring their Gods to them, and keep them with them; they made uſe of various Modes, and Rites of Worſhip which they thought beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Gods, and whereby they might invite their favour to them, and preſence with them; Yea, they worſhipped ſeveral Creatures, though not as Gods, but yet that in worſhipping them, they might have ſome Communion with thoſe Gods that they thought did preſide over thoſe Creatures they Worſhipt: as <hi>Vulcan</hi> over the <hi>Fire, Neptune</hi> over the <hi>Sea, Ceres</hi> over the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe vain apprehenſions of the Heathen by ſuch means to have Fellowſhip with their Gods, yet the Apoſtle ſays, they ſacrificed to Devils, and not to God, and had Fellowſhip with Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. <hi>I would not ſaith he that ye ſhould have Fellowſhip with Devils.</hi> But the ways of this Communion (as I ſaid) muſt be thoſe which God himſelf hath appointed; the principal whereof are Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By Jeſus Chriſt, who was figured upon this account by <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder that ſtood betwixt Heaven and Earth, as the Perſon wherein Heaven and Earth are united; God and Man have Communion with each other, who was alſo figured by the Temple, whither the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came up to meet, and have communion with God, and God with them; And particularly by the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> where God promiſed to meet his people, and commune with them; and therefore the Apoſtle addeth here in the Text, <hi>Our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for on our part, all our acceſs to God is by him. Eph. 2.18. <hi>Through him we both have an acceſs unto the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) All Gods approaches to us are alſo through him: All that Light, Life, and Love; which God communicates to his people, is through him alone. And we have this Communion through Chriſt with God.</p>
            <pb n="1025" facs="tcp:42587:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By virtue of his <hi>Incarnation;</hi> He aſſumed our Nature into Union and Communion with God, and ſo made way for our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By virtue of his <hi>Life</hi> he lived here in the World; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in the Holy Example he hath left us to walk by, or the Doctrine that he here preached; by both which he did guide and lead Men in the right way to Fellowſhip with his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By virtue of his <hi>Death,</hi> and making reconciliation for us by his Blood; for if there had not been a Reconciliation, and an agreement made between God and us, we could never have had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; <hi>How can two walk together if they be not agreed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This Communion with God it is ſome lower entrance into the Holyeſt of all in this World, and this is ſaid to be by the Blood of Jeſus; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By vertue of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> whereby Believers come to be raiſed up to newneſs of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. And it is only in this New Life, that we have all our Communion with God; the Old Man in us is not capable of it, nor the Powers of Nature, till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, raiſed, and quickned through the power of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By vertue alſo of his Aſcenſion into Heaven; from whence deſcends upon Believers a Divine Influence and Power through Faith, whereby they are carryed up above this World, and aſcend up to Heaven, and into Communion with God; as the Apoſtle argues; Col. 3.1. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By virtue of his <hi>Interceſſion;</hi> For this is one great thing that he Intercedes for with his Father in Heaven, that his People might have Union and Communion with them; as appears by what Chriſt prays for <hi>John</hi> 17.21. in the behalf of his Diſciples, <hi>that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us,</hi> and ſo have Communion with us; ſo that all theſe things I have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, ye ſee tend to this great end, to bring up the Saints of God into this Communion with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Communion with God is alſo by the Spirit of God: as the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13, 14. ſpeaks of the <hi>Communion of the Holy Ghoſt; The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> The Grace of Chriſt, and the Love of God are communicated by the Holy Ghoſt: So that all our Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="1026" facs="tcp:42587:348" rendition="simple:additions"/> with the Father and the Son, are by the Spirit. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth effect this Communion with God</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By Sanctifying our Hearts, and aſſimilating our Natures to the Nature of God; for there can be no Communion where there is no likeneſs of Nature. What <hi>Communion</hi> hath <hi>Light</hi> with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>Fire</hi> with <hi>Water?</hi> becauſe there is no ſimilitude in their Natures; As the Elements that have ſymbolical qualities, and ſome likeneſs in their Nature do eaſily paſs one into the other by a Natural tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this Communion with God, there muſt be ſome ſuitableneſs and likeneſs between God and the Soul, and that enmity and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which is in our Natures to him, muſt be removed by the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying operation of the Holy Spirit in us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By elevating, and raiſing the Soul above its Natural power and reach. The Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth between <hi>the Soul and Spirit</hi> in Man; the Spirit is the ſuperior part of the Soul, and it is in the Spirit that we have our Communion with God, who is a Spirit: As the Union and Communion between the Soul and the Body in Nature, is by the Superiour and moſt refined part of the Body, which are the <hi>Vital, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits; ſo our Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is by the Spirit the ſupreme part of the Soul, and that elevated and raiſed by the Spirit of God above its own Natural capacity or power.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal wayes for <hi>Communion with God,</hi> but then there are ſubordinate wayes which are the Ordinances and Inſtitutions of God for that end: For God hath in all ages been training up his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this, to have Communion with himſelf; and therefore he did appoint <hi>Ordinances</hi> for that end under the Law; there were <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Altars.</hi> and <hi>Solemn Feaſts</hi> appointed of God, eſpecially the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> erected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all for this end, that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might therein draw nigh to him, and have Communion with him. And ſo in the New Teſtament God hath his Ordinances alſo appointed for this end; as <hi>Prayer, Hearing the Word, Singing of Pſalms, Baptiſm,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which is therefore called the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> as that Ordinance wherein we have a more ſpecial Communion with Chriſt, and with God in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is to be done more particularly on our part to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and maintain it alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In general, we are to deſire it, and pant after it as the moſt beneficial and neceſſary thing in the World; Many have it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire it not: They ſatisfie themſelves in their converſe with things below, and the Communion they have with things ſenſible and natural, and deſire not this Communion with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. You are to make it your ſcope and end in all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances you approach to, to have therein Communion with God. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="1027" facs="tcp:42587:348" rendition="simple:additions"/> come to them out of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> ſome out of <hi>curioſity,</hi> and others in <hi>hypocriſie;</hi> and ſo find not that Communion with God which elſe they might obtain if they did make it their great ſcope and end. <hi>David</hi> teſtifies his great longing that he had after the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God; but it was for this end that he might there meet with God, and have Communion with him; as he expreſſeth it in the Pſal. 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, to dwell in the Houſe of the Lord, that I may ſee the Beauty of the Lord, and enquire in his Temple:</hi> And again, Pſal. 63. <hi>O God my God, early will I ſeek thee, my Soul thirſteth for thee, that I may ſee thy Power and thy Glory as I have ſeen thee in thy Sanctuary,</hi> which is in effect that he might there have Communion with God. But to ſpeak to this more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we would have Communion with God, <hi>we muſt keep up the exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt,</hi> for it is (as I ſaid) by him that we have all our Communion with God; therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> had his Name <hi>Immanuel</hi> given to him, which ſignifies <hi>God with us.</hi> Let Faith look upon God as in Chriſt, and ſo we may behold him reconciled, we may behold him coming down to us in our own Nature, we may behold him upon a Throne of Grace, and as entred into a Covenant of Grace, whereby we may with a greater freedome and boldneſs have acceſs unto him, which is the <hi>active part</hi> of this Communion with God; and through Faith in Chriſt, God alſo communicates himſelf by his Spirit to his People in Light, Life, and Love, which is this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the <hi>paſſive part</hi> of it. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.15. ſaith to this purpoſe, <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him, and he in God.</hi> This Confeſſion is an act of Faith, and if it be not only from the Mouth, but from the Heart, it leadeth the Soul into this Communion with God, expreſſed in our part, by our dwelling in God, and on Gods part by his dwelling in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Keep up a dayly exerciſe of Repentance,</hi> that ſo no new Sin, nor the Guilt of it in the Conſcience may hinder and interrupt our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. For who can ſay <hi>his Heart is clean? He is pure from ſin,</hi> and therefore there is need of dayly Repentance, that ſin may not interrupt our Communion with God, which it will do, if we abide impenitently under it. The Apoſtle ſpeaks in this Chapter of Fellow-ſhip with God, and here in the Text, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adds, <hi>If any man ſay he hath no ſin, he deceiveth himſelf:</hi> So that this Communion with God may conſiſt with the Being of ſin, but not with impenitence under it; and therefore adds, <hi>If we confeſs our ſin, he is faithful and juſt to forgive it;</hi> and we know that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin is one great part of Repentance; and when Sin is thus confeſſed and forgiven, it need not hinder our Fellowſhip with God. The Apoſtle alſo mentioneth in my Text, Fellowſhip with God, and the cleanſing of us from ſin by the Blood of Chriſt; both theſe are put together, ſo that to maintain this Fellowſhip with God, we muſt be cleanſed from ſin, which is done meritoriouſly
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:42587:349" rendition="simple:additions"/> by the Blood of Chriſt, but on our part upon the Conditions of Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep up a conſtant courſe of Prayer, and praiſing God.</hi> (1.) Prayer. Prayer is a ſpecial Ordinance for Communion with God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo much commanded in Scripture. <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in one place, <hi>Pray all manner of Prayer in the Spirit,</hi> as he ſpeaks in another place. For if it be not a Prayer in the Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Faith and fervour of Soul we may pray, and yet have no Communion with God. Prayer is compared to incenſe, but it doth not aſcend to Heaven but in the Fire of Holy Affection kindled by the Spirit. And Chriſt therefore propounded ſeveral Parables to put men upon Fervency, Faith and Perſeverance in Prayer, which are ſo well known, that I need not mention them. If the Soul draws nigh to God in any Duty, it will be this; And ſo Gods drawing nigh to the Soul is experienced to be much in this Duty of Prayer. Chriſt himſelf had his Transfiguration from Heaven, and the Glory of God ſhining forth upon him while he was praying, as you read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.29. And the experience of the Saints can much witneſs to this, what <hi>viſits</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> they have had, and transfiguring <hi>views of Heavenly Glory</hi> in this Duty of Prayer. And then (2.) Keep up a conſtant courſe of Praiſing God. <hi>Praiſe, it is the great Ordinance of Heaven for Communion with God in a State of Perfection;</hi> and as we are able to reach it in our preſent State, it will raiſe the Soul into Communion with God. The Soul is in its higheſt Operations when it is praiſing God, and the higher the Acts of the Soul are, the nearer it doth approach to him who is the moſt <hi>High God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Keep your ſelves pure;</hi> Though by Purity, I mean not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Purity, but watchfulneſs againſt all Sins and Temptations; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting every Sin, Living in no ſin, and a continued endeavour to mortifie all Sin in our ſelves: The Purer the Soul is, the fitter it is for Communion with God. The promiſe of ſeeing God is by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made to the pure in Heart; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. and with the pure, God will ſhew himſelf pure, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 18.26. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaking concerning this Communion with God, <hi>James</hi> 4.8. which he expreſſeth by our drawing nigh to God, and his drawing nigh to us adds this Exhortation, <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye Sinners, and purifie your Hearts ye double minded.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the ſame thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17. and thereupon adviſeth them to keep themſelves pure. <hi>What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath Light with Darkneſs, Righteouſneſs with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore be you ſeparate, and touch no unclean things ſaith the Lord, and I will dwell and walk in the midſt of you.</hi> Under the Law God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Porters to keep their Watch at the Doors of the Temple, that nothing might enter in to defile that Temple, which was his dwelling place. The <hi>Soul</hi> is to be <hi>Gods Temple</hi> for him to dwell in,
<pb n="1029" facs="tcp:42587:349" rendition="simple:additions"/> and therefore we ſhould watch againſt whatſoever may enter in to defile our Souls, whereby we may be fitter dwellings for him, and for Communion with him. And the Prieſts under the Law were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to purifie themſelves before they drew nigh to God in his Temple; Yea, and the People alſo before they came to the Paſſeover, and thoſe folemn Feaſts wherein they did draw nigh to God, they were to purifie and cleanſe themſelves. And the very Heathen before they entred their <hi>Solemn Sacrifices</hi> would have their Cryer to proclaim to the People <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Holy things are for Holy Perſons.</hi> And they would write this Inſcription over the Doors of their Temple, <hi>Nemo immundus huc ingreditor.</hi> Let no unclean Perſon enter in here. And all their Luſtrations and waſhings they uſed to the Living, and their purging Fires which they dream'd of for Souls after Death, and which are ſtill kept up in the Holy Water, and Purgatory of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church do confirm the truth of this Notion, as that which is ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the minds of all Men, that purity is required as neceſſary in all our approaches to God, and Communion with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let God be much in your Thoughts, and in the view of your Mind; not only when you approach ſome ſolemn Ordinance, but in the whole courſe of your actions: when you go forth, and come in; when ye lie down, and riſe up. Let the Creatures you converſe with, the ſeveral diſpenſations of Divine Providence towards you, preſent God to your Thoughts, and the view of your Minds. For how can Men that have ſeldom any Thoughts of God, maintain any Communion with him. Our Communion with God is not as it is with Creatures, in a ſenſible way, but it is by the inward Thoughts and Exerciſe of the Mind; which therefore we ought to be frequent in.</p>
            <p>We ſhould with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. <hi>Set the Lord alwaies before our face;</hi> and not as he that he ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. of whom its ſaid, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> This is rather to live without God in the World, than to live in Communion with him. And theſe Thoughts of God ſhould not be ſlight, and tranſient, but fixed and ſerious, eſpecially at ſome times, which we ſhould more peculiarly denote to <hi>ſolemn</hi> Meditation. Meditation brings the Object nearer to the Soul, and the Soul near to it, though locally diſtant; unites the Soul to it, mixeth it ſelf with it, whereby it doth poſſeſs it, or is poſſeſſed of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Practiſe Self-denyal, for he that abideth in himſelf, and liveth in and to himſelf, liveth at a diſtance from God. God and Self are as two Oppoſite Terms, we muſt forſake the one, if we would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the other. When Man firſt fell from God, he fell in with himſelf, and therefore muſt forſake himſelf if he would return to God, and have Communion with him.</p>
            <pb n="1030" facs="tcp:42587:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>There is a twofold Self-denyal. One is <hi>Internal;</hi> when we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves in all high Thoughts of our ſelves, Confidence in our ſelves, all ſelf-ends, ſelf-<hi>applauſe,</hi> ſelf-ſufficiency, and do even <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> our ſelves; this is highly requiſite to our Communion with God. Self is that <hi>Dagon</hi> that muſt fall before Gods Ark; that Idol that muſt be caſt out of the Temple of Mans Soul, that God may enter in, and dwell there.</p>
            <p>Then there is a Self-denyal that is external, which God ſometimes calls his people to in Order to Communion with himſelf. As to forſake Father, Mother, Houſe, Land, Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this in order to the receiving the <hi>hundred fold in this Life,</hi> as our Saviour hath promiſed, which they ſhall receive in this Communion with God. An eminent inſtance of this we have in <hi>Galeacius Caracciolus,</hi> who left his Countrey, Kindred, Eſtate, Honour, that he poſſeſt at home, to enjoy Communion with God in the purer Ordinances of the Reformed Church at <hi>Geneva;</hi> and being tempted by Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return, anſwered, <hi>His Money periſh with him that thinks all the Gold and Silver in the World worth one days Communion with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He found all that he had left an hundred fold in this Communion he had with God and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Walk in Love. This I add, becauſe our Apoſtle doth ſo much inſiſt upon it in this Epiſtle. Love is an Affection requiſite to all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; To Communion with Saints among themſelves, and to Communion with God. <hi>For God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> 1 John 4.16. And this mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling is this Communion I am treating of.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher ſaith of Love, it doth transferr <hi>amantem</hi> in <hi>ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> it carries the Soul from home to live and dwell in the perſon or thing beloved. It is <hi>vinculum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nionis,</hi> the band of Union; and all Communion is founded in Union. And therefore where there is no Love, how can there be Communion; and where Men do not walk in Love, how can they walk in Communion with God. If Chriſtians walk in Strife, Envy, Debates, Emulation, Contention, they will not hereby be only hindred in their Communion with one another, but with God alſo.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And Laſtly. Let the People of God walk in Fellowſhip with one another: Let them be all united to ſome particular viſible Church, where they may enjoy all thoſe Ordinances of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which God hath inſtituted for Communion with himſelf: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Catholick Church whereof Chriſt is the Supream Head and Paſtor, there are particular Churches under the praeſidency and care of particular Paſtours, to ſome of which all profeſſed Chriſtians ought to belong in order to their Communion with God, and one another. But upon this third General I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Application.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="1031" facs="tcp:42587:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>IV. I ſhall now come to the Fourth and laſt General I propoſed to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">General. </seg>IV</label> ſpeak to, and that is the Conſequences or Conſectaries that ariſe from this whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It follows hence that Communion with God is a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſect. </seg>1</label> duty; It comprehends much in it. It conſiſts not in one ſingle Grace, or one ſingle Act of the Soul, or one ſingle Duty of Religion, but it comprehends the Exerciſe of many Graces, reacheth to manifold Duties of Religion, and conſiſteth of manifold Acts and Operations of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is alſo a conſtant Duty, which we are to maintain in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſect. </seg>2</label> courſe, and not only now and then at ſome ſolemn times, or at ſome ſolemn Ordinance: Not as if we ought to do nothing elſe but worſhip God, which is the Communion reſerved for Heaven, but it is to be our dayly practiſe, and to ſet ſome time apart for it every day, and as much as we can to carry this Communion with God through the ſeveral Affairs, Conditions, and Actions of our Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 21. The <hi>Heb.</hi> is, Accuſtome thy ſelf with God, which importeth ſome fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent courſe of approaching to God, and converſe with him. And when it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> that they walked with God: It implies a conſtant courſe of Religion, and Communion with God. And when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>our Converſation is in Heaven,</hi> it implies more than the performance now and then ſome Religious Worſhip, but ſome conſtant converſe with God, and the things of Heaven, as Citizens of the ſame civil Body or Society have among themſelves in their civil Commerce and Converſation with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as the <hi>Greek</hi> word there uſed doth import.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. No Creatures are capable of Communion with God, but Angels <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſect. </seg>3</label> and Men. The Beaſts were not made for it, nor are capable of it, not being rational, and intelligent Beings: This Communion with God requires the exerciſe of Reaſon, and Underſtanding, and that in the higheſt improvements of them. If we conſider it either in the Active, or Paſſive part of it, the Beaſts are not capable of it. Though God hath Communicated ſomething of himſelf to all his Creatures, and as the <hi>Poet</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Jovis omnia plena,</hi> all things are full of God, and his Infinite Being is in all Finite Beings; yet no Creatures have Communion with him, but Angels and Men: Other Creatures have a Natural inſtinct or ſagacity to preſerve and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their reſpective Natures, or Beings, but have no ſenſe of their Creator, no impreſſion of a Deity upon their Nature, nor no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faculties whereby they might be capable of Communion with God.</p>
            <p>The Angels have Communion with God in Heaven, they <hi>alwaies, behold the face of God,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks; So the Spirits of juſt men
<pb n="1032" facs="tcp:42587:351" rendition="simple:additions"/> departed are with Chriſt; and in nearer Communion with God; than when they dwelt in their Tabernacles of Fleſh. And the Saints upon Earth alſo are not without it, though in a lower degree; whereby the Church Militant hath Communion with the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in this Communion that both have with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. whieh ſhews the excellency of rational Creatures above all others, that they alone are capable of this high Employment, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſect. </seg>4</label> 4. The Supreme felicity of Angels and Men lies in Communion with God: As they alone are capable of it, ſo their felicity conſiſteth in it. God hath provided a good ſuitable to the Natures of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in the enjoying of which is their chief happineſs; but the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of rational and intelligent Creatures lies in himſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their firſt Creation they were made happy in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</p>
            <p>And herein conſiſteth the chief miſery of fall'n Angels, and fall'n Man; that they both fell from their Communion with God. The Angels ſo fell, as never to be reſtored to it again: And man ſo fell alſo, as not to be able of himſelf to return to it. But God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a way for man by Chriſt to be brought back again to him, which if he neglects or refuſeth, he will then be caſt into the ſame hopeleſs Condition with the Devil and his Angels.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſect. </seg>5</label> 5. The higheſt improvement of the faculties of the Soul are to Employ them in Communion with God. They are then in their higheſt Operation upon the higheſt Object. Though they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about things of this lower World, and ought ſo to be in their proper bounds; yet theſe are not their higheſt Operations which they are capable of. As the higheſt uſe that could be made of Beaſts under the Law, was to make them Sacrifices to God; and when the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> brought Gold, Silver, Purple, Scarlet, and precious Stones for the uſe and ſervice of the Sanctuary, they devoted them to the higheſt ſervice they were capable of. So when the faculties of the Soul are made a Sanctuary to God, and employed in Communion with him, they receive their higheſt improvement.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Communion with God is the Life of Religion: It is but a dead thing without it. All Religion hath reſpect to a Deity, either to confer Honour upon it, or to have Communion with it, eſpecially the true Religion; without the former it finds no acceptance with God, without the latter it is unprofitable to our ſelves, yea, we may grow worſe under all our profeſſion. What the Body is without the Soul, and what the matter without the form, that is Religion, where men find no Influence from Heaven upon their Hearts, and have no Communion with God. I next proceed to the Application.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="1033" facs="tcp:42587:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>I. Take notice with an holy admiration of the condeſcending good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>I</label> of God; to admit any of the Sons of Men into fellowſhip with himſelf. That there ſhould be fellowſhip where there is ſuch infinite inequality, ſuch infinite diſtance, yea, with ſuch as had provok't him, and diſobliged him by their wilful departure from him.</p>
            <p>To aſſume our Nature into Union and Communion with God was great condeſcent; and ſo it is to receive any of our perſons. <hi>Will God indeed dwell on Earth</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he had built God an Houſe for him to dwell in amongſt his people. For God to approach in wayes of ſuch kindneſs to Men, as to communicate himſelf to them as I ſaid before, and to admit men to make ſuch near approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to himſelf, both theſe manifeſt his great goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Take notice wherein Chriſtianity excels Philoſophy, properly <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>II</label> ſo call'd. The one directs us the way to Communion with God, which the other cannot do. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſpeaks nothing of the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> the Man, Chriſt Jeſus, by whom alone we can draw nigh to God. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> improves the Principles of meer Nature, but cannot confer a new Nature; doth not infuſe ſuch Principles as the Goſpel doth, to lead men into Communion with God. <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> whether Natural, or Moral, hath an excellency in it, in its proper Sphaere, but yet falls far ſhort of Chriſtianity, the Principles of the Goſpel, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith, wherein Men are led to the true knowledge of God, and fellowſhip with him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. This may be matter of Lamentation in this prophane and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>III</label> Age, that there is ſo little of this Communion with God to be found among men. Some underſtand not what it is; ſome deſire it not, nor ſeek after it; ſome have loſt what once they had. And ſome deride and ſcoff at it as a fooliſh fancy, a dream, a deluſion of ſome fanatick people.</p>
            <p>Though ſome may pretend to it that have it not, yet God forbid we ſhould deny it. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the Text aſſerteth it, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of real Chriſtians in all Ages bears witneſs to it. And if it be not a fancy, but a real thing, I am ſure it is the moſt ſolemn and important thing in the whole World.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But why are there ſo few that attain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Some are under an evil heart of unbelief, <hi>whereby they depart from the living God. Heb.</hi> 3.12. And what ſtands oppoſite to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him more than departing from him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others walk in Hypocriſie, and have only External Communion with the Church, and Ordinances of it, but for want of true Grace,
<pb n="1034" facs="tcp:42587:352" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſincerity in their hearts have no real Communion with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others walk in Pride, and <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, knoweth him afar off,</hi> and all Communion with God is intercepted hereby.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others are in ſuch friendſhip with the World, which as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, is <hi>Enmity againſt God;</hi> and where there is Enmity, there can be no Communion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others are under the diſturbance of head-ſtrong Paſſions, and Communion with God, requires a quiet, ſerene, and ſedate frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Others concern themſelves only about Diſputes and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion, and mind not that wherein the Life and Power of it conſiſteth, which is Communion with God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Others ſatisfie themſelves with notions and ſpeculations, with fine Language, ſtrains of Rhetorick, well compiled forms of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and look no farther.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Others give way to wandring thoughts, and ſerve God with a diſtracted mind, whereby their Hearts are carryed from God, even while they are ſerving of him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Others make Religion meer matter of Diſcourſe, pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to talk of it, and that's all.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And Laſtly, Others are fall'n into down right Atheiſm, queſtion Gods very Being, and indeed are of no Religion at all, and can have no Communion with the Deity which they doubt of, or deny.</p>
            <p>Now is not this to be <hi>lamented,</hi> for Men to have no <hi>Communion</hi> with that God who gave them their Being; that God, in whoſe favour is their Life, that God, in whom is treaſured up the true felicity of Man. God is a <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Living water,</hi> a <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>endleſs Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> an <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>all Perfection</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but what is this to him that hath no Communion with him; and hath not a drop of all this falling upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>But in ſtead of this Communion with God, have not theſe Men Fellowſhip with unrighteouſneſs, and the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Apoſtle forbids, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. Fellowſhip with the Adulterer, or Adultereſs in Uncleanneſs, with the Swearer in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Oaths; with the Unjuſt in Unrighteouſneſs, with the deceiver in his frauds, the Lyer in falſe Speaking, the Drunkard i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> riotous and intemperate Drinking, which Men call good Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="1035" facs="tcp:42587:352" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I could wiſh that the Fellowſhip that men call club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing at Taverns, and Coffee-houſes at unſeaſonable hours, whereby the duties of their Families are neglected, were forborn at this day. Certainly, a more circumſpect walking is required of us, eſpecially ſuch as pretend to Religion in a day wherein God is viſiting the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rebuking his own people for their Iniquities.</p>
            <p>And many in ſtead of Fellowſhip with God, have Fellowſhip with the Devil. I mean not ſo much, Witches, Sorcerers, or ſuch as Confederate expreſly with him, but ſuch as <hi>do his Luſts,</hi> and carry on his work in the World. What is the Devils great work? Is it not to propagate Wickedneſs, to perſecute the Church, to obſtruct the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to foment Diviſions, to corrupt the Truth with Error, and to ſow Tares among the Wheat. And how many are there that have Fellowſhip with the Devil in ſuch works as thoſe: But they little think of the Fellowſhip they are in danger to have with him in his Torments, who at preſent have this Fellowſhip with him in theſe works of Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall next proceed to exhort men to ſeek after this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>IV</label> with God.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall firſt ſpeak to ſuch as are meer ſtrangers to it; have lived many years in the World, and in a Land where the Goſpel hath been long preached, and yet know nothing of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me perſwade them that there is really ſuch a thing, and that all that is ſpoken of it, is not meer canting, and vain pretence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me perſwade them ſeriouſly to ſeek it, and to make it the great work of their lives, and their great ſcope and end in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to attain unto it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Goſpel invites ſinners to Chriſt, let them make haſte to him, that in him they may have their peace made with God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Grace whereby they may be capable of Communion with him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let them no longer walk in darkneſs: <hi>For if we ſay we have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in this Chapter. And here remember what I ſpake in the opening of the Text. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs, Knowledge</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs, Truth</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs, Holineſs</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> are <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Let Men then firſt walk wiſely, and not as Fools. Wiſdom lyes in chooſing to a Mans ſelf a good end, and in fitting means ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that end, let Men do this: Wiſdom lies in preferring things according to their true worth and value, let Men do ſo. Wiſdom lies in embracing of Seaſons, and redeeming of Time; let Men pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe this; Wiſdom lies in looking to things in their End and Iſſue, and not only how they appear at the preſent, let Men do this alſo. And ſecondly I ſaid, <hi>Knowledge</hi> is <hi>Light, Ignorance</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> Would you then have Communion with God, you muſt not abide in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:42587:353" rendition="simple:additions"/> but read the Scriptures, Enquire into the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and know the way of coming to God, and Communion with him by Chriſt Jeſus, and to an Everlaſting Communion with him in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> is <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> Take heed therefore of falſe Doctrines, eſpecially ſuch as may tend to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing this Communion with God. Take heed of <hi>Socinian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in denying, Chriſts ſatisfaction, the Trinity, and the Godhead of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed of Popiſh Doctrines, which tell you of other merits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the merits of Chriſt, other ſatisfaction, other Mediation, and other Headſhip of the Church beſides Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take heed of the Leaven of Quakeriſm, which ſets up the Light of Nature for Chriſt, and caſt off the uſe of thoſe Ordinances which Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Take heed of the old <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrines that ſet up the Power of Nature, and are ſince revived under other Names, to the denyal or neglect of that help of the Spirit which is neceſſary to our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I ſaid, <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> are <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> He therefore that would have Communion with God, muſt break off from his Sin, betake himſelf to a courſe of Godlineſs, and Holy walking with God. In the Apoſtles time roſe up a Sect of carnal Profeſſors, who would talk high of Fellowſhip with God, and yet walk after the Fleſh, and indulge their Luſts: Whom he is thought eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to referr to in this Chapter, that they thus walking in Darkneſs, cannot have Fellowſhip with that God who is Light.</p>
            <p>The next branch of the Exhortation I direct to ſuch as are in the practice and experience of this Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Maintain it in what Conſtancy you can. The fewer interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are admitted therein, ſo much the better. Take heed of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, take heed of diſtracting Cares, take heed of Diverſions from Duties and Ordinances you ought to attend unto. Take heed of the ſnares of bad Company, of the influence of bad Examples, of the carnal Counſels of your own Heart, of any Complyances againſt your Conſciences, of any doubts and diſputes in your Mind about the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles of all Religion, eſpecially that Chriſtian Religion that you make profeſſion of. And watch over the Levity and inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of your own minds, which of it ſelf alone may hinder our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in this duty. Yea, and the very lawful Affairs of our calling, eſpecially if much incumbred, may interrupt us herein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Advance it to an higher degree; That your Communion with God may grow up into a greater intimacy, ſuch as the Church, the Spowſe of Chriſt is repreſented to have in the Book of <hi>Canticles.</hi> He that can attain it, let him attain it. In <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder which
<pb n="1037" facs="tcp:42587:353" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtood betwixt Heaven and Earth, there were many rounds. In an high Mountain there are ſeveral degrees of aſcent. At Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the people ſtood at the bottom, ſome of the Prieſts, and the Seventy Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went up a little way, but <hi>Moſes</hi> was at the top. Let us aſcend this Mount as high as we can, only know it is not Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but Mount <hi>Sion</hi> we muſt aſcend to have Communion with God.</p>
            <p>And be not diſcouraged if you meet with ſome difficulties in your aſcent through the Natural bent of your Hearts towards things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, The ſweetneſs and advantage you will reap herein, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompence all the labour and endeavours after it.</p>
            <p>And may not ſome eminent degree of Communion with God be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of ſuch as do not only live in the times of the New Teſtament, but have had a long ſtanding in the Church of God; that your growth herein may in ſome meaſure be proportion'd to your time and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for it.</p>
            <p>And that which ſhould quicken you the more, is the preſent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi> of the times both at home and abroad. We know not what dayes are coming, <hi>Mens Hearts are failing them for fear of what Evils are coming upon the Earth;</hi> as our Saviour foretold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. now nothing will ſo fortifie the Soul againſt an evil day, and an hour of Temptation as this Communion with God. This will ſweeten a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſweeten Poverty, ſweeten Baniſhment, ſweeten the very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Death.</p>
            <p>This ſweetned the Martyrs ſufferings of old: that Fellowſhip they had with God in thoſe ſufferings, wherein they had fellowſhip al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with Chriſt in his Death.</p>
            <p>Now let theſe things put you on to this great work: And be not diſcouraged becauſe of the infinite diſtance betwixt God and us. He is come down to us in our own Nature in Chriſt, that we may have acceſs to him, <hi>and his terror not make us afraid.</hi> And hear what he ſpeaks himſelf to our encouragement, Iſa. 57. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, I dwell in the high and holy place with him alſo that is of a contrite Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. The moſt high God thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf to men.</p>
            <p>But God is inviſible, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> and how can I have Communion with one whom I ſee not.</p>
            <p>Its true, We cannot have a ſenſible Communion with Him, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> as Men have with one another; but Spirits that are inviſible, have converſe together, as well as ſenſible Creatures. God is a Spirit, and the Soul of Man is a Spirit, and ſo may be capeable of Communion with that God who is a Spirit. Had not the Apoſtle Communion with inviſible things, when he ſaith, <hi>We look not to the things which are ſeen, but to the things which are not ſeen?</hi> And doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, <hi>Whom having not ſeen, you love:</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>And is not Faith the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="1038" facs="tcp:42587:354" rendition="simple:additions"/> of things not ſeen?</hi> Heb. 11.1. And though in himſelf he is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet he made himſelf viſible in Chriſt, who is the Image of the Inviſible God. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>V</label> V. Having ſpoke of this Communion with God, I ſhall add one Uſe about the Communion of Saints: We know it is one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our <hi>Creed:</hi> And that which the Apoſtle in this Chapter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to; <hi>Theſe things have we written to you, that ye may have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us:</hi> with us as Apoſtles, and with us as Believers. So that the fellowſhip of Saints comprehends their fellowſhip with the Father, and their fellowſhip with the Son, and their fellowſhip with the Apoſtles, and from thence fellowſhip with one another.</p>
            <p>All Saints and Churches that hold fellowſhip with theſe three, ought to have fellowſhip among themſelves. To bring in new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or new Rules of Worſhip not delivered by the Apoſtles, is to forſake Communion with the Apoſtles. The terms of Communion laid by the Apoſtles for the Churches of Chriſt ought to be kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable in all Churches to the end of the World, and be the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Communion among themſelves. And for my part I can hold Communion with any Church where theſe are maintained; though there may be ſome Circumſtantial differences either in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Practiſe; eſpecially if they are not impoſed, as neceſſary. For this hath made ſuch woful Diviſions in the Church, the making things unneceſſary, and doubtful the neceſſary terms of Church-Communion. Was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf the truly Ancient, Catholick, and Apoſtolick Church, as ſhe ſtiles her ſelf, I could have Communion with it. They that leave the Apoſtles, ſhake the Foundation of the Churches ſtability, and forſake the center of its Unity. The Lord help us all to underſtand the way of Peace and Union in this miſerably divided Age.</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter we find the Lord Jeſus under two very different Exerciſes: in the one attended with much Solemnity, in the other under great Perplexity: much Courted, much caſt Down; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honoured, and exceedingly Troubled; and he beareth both, with wonderful Equanimity. <hi>He is Feaſted at Bethany</hi> v. 1, 2. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oyle of Spiknard very coſtly,</hi> v. 3. <hi>Rideth Tryumphantly into Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 12, 13. &amp;c.

               <hi>The hour is come that the Son of Man ſhould be Glorified.</hi> Why; Had he not been Glorifying throughout this Chapter? yea!

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Meer Trouble is no Sin.</hi> Chriſts <hi>Soul was Troubled</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it is Mudded, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.4, 7. Not that thier was any mixture of Sin in his Trouble: it was ſuch as might conſiſt with his pure unſpotted Nature. If grief be not groundleſs, if not extravagant, no Sainted with unbelief, or effected of diſobedience: 'tis but Natures Weakneſs, Grace induceth no Stoical Stupidity. 'Tis no property of the Goſpel; to make Men Senſleſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Fear of Death, and ſenſe of the Wrath of God, are of all things moſt Perplexing. Now is my Soul Troubled.</hi> Now I am to conflict with the Father's Anger, Mens Malice, and Death's Pains and Terrours: and now, not my Fleſh only, but <hi>my Soul is Troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Extream diſtreſs of Spirit is of an amazing Nature.</hi> Chriſt had not the Freedom of Prayer. <hi>What ſhall I ſay?</hi> and then what he did ſay, was corrected, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.39, 42.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>No Extremity can Ordinarily, or ſhould really put an Holy Soul, by the Plea of, or hope in his Relation to God,</hi> Chriſt calls God <hi>Father. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Matt. 27.46.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Prayer muſt be ſuited to the Occaſion, Save me from the Hour,</hi> &amp;c. A great Argument againſt moſt forms, is, that an Holy Soul cannot reliſh them, nor can I ſee how God accepts them, becauſe they are impertinent, or not full to the caſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>In our Extremitys, we may be importunate, muſt not be Peremptory, with God in Prayer.</hi> Our Saviour here Prayed not more Heartily, then ſubmiſſively, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.39.</p>
            <p>Our Text is the Reſult of the Lords Wraſtling, both with his own Soul, and with his Father.</p>
            <p>Here is firſt Chriſts Prayer. <hi>Father, Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Text we have Two things, 1. The Compellation, <hi>Father.</hi> 2. The Petition, <hi>Glorify</hi> &amp;c. 1. The Compellation <hi>Father.</hi> Prayer ought to
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:42587:355" rendition="simple:additions"/> be Uſhered in with ſome Suitable Title of God, which is expreſſive of his Supremacy, our Reverence of him, and Relation to him. All theſe are Couched in the Single word <hi>Father.</hi> Read, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Title expreſſeth God's Authority, and Chirſt's Allegiance both owned by him in this little Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Relation.</hi> The Lords Petitioners muſt ask ſo as to aſſure themſelves of Acceptation: which the Recognition of our Intereſt in God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Read Iſa.</hi> 63, 16.</note> as our Father in Chriſt, is very proper to Effect. Hence the Rule of Prayer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with <hi>Our Father.</hi> And it is moſt Suitable to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Goſpel, that believers call God Father in Prayer, having the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Son pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon them to this End, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Petition <hi>Father, Glorify thy Name,</hi> q. d. Be thou rather Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then I Spared. If I dye, thy Glory will make amends for my Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Death, where note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Submiſſion to the will of the Father. He puts himſelf into his Fathers hands, and Subjects himſelf to his pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His deſign, <hi>the Fathers glory, Glorify thy Name.</hi> He doth not ſay ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let my Agony and Death come: but <hi>Glorify,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> This being the means of thy Glory, which thou haſt fixt upon, here I am, do to me as ſeemeth good in thy Sight. Hence obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The beſt way to quiet and compoſe our Spirits in time of diſtreſs, is the Prayer of Faith.</hi> Wraſtle with God and you Conquer your own Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatings. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10, 11, 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That Soul will be heard, who forgets or neglects himſelf in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and Prayeth for the Accompliſhment of the Will, and Glory of God.</hi> So doth Chriſt here, and God heard him, See. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Our Exemption from ſuffering may ſometimes be inconſiſtent with the Glory of God. Save me from this hour</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but for this cauſe came I unto this hour; Father Glorify thy Name.</hi> The Ground of the Point lyes in his Correction of his firſt Petition.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The beſt and moſt Effectual means to prepare our ſelves to meet God either in the way of Mercy or Judgment, is to reſign our ſelves</hi> to <hi>the Soveraign Will of God, to be diſpoſed of for his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall prove the Doctrin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Open the Nature of this reſigned Frame of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Give ſome Arguments, manifeſting that it is our Duty, eſpecially in a Day of Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Apply the whole.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the firſt: I lay down this Suppoſition, That believer who is prepared for Affliction, is prepared for Salvation; that the ſame qualification fits for both theſe diſpenſations. I know ſome are <hi>Veſſels of Wrath fitted only for Diſtruction, Ro.</hi> 9.22. If the Apoſtle did there Treat of a Moral preparation, which I know he doth not, then we muſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between Deſtruction and Affliction; and of the fitneſs of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Wrath for that, and Saints for this. But to decide this matter. Our
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:42587:356" rendition="simple:additions"/> Doctrine and Queſtion, ſpeaks of an Holy, Gracious Preparation for Sufferings, to bear them quietly and benificially, not of a judicial Aptitude for Ruin, much leſs an Eternal act of Preterition, which is the Apoſtles meaning there. This premiſed, I ſuppoſe, none will deny him who is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily qualified for Suffering: to be in a bleſſed readineſs for comfortable Diſpenſations and Providences.</p>
            <p>Now that the above mentioned Reſignation to the will of God for his Glory, Prepareth a Soul, both for Mercy or Judgment, Suffering, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, appeareth as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that we find Holy Men of Old, in this Spirit ready for either Diſpenſation, Tribulation or Comfort, Adverſity or Proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> ſhall be our Firſt Inſtance, his Reſignation is notably expreſſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Naked came I out of my Mothers Woumb, and Naked ſhall I return Thither; The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh, Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> The good Man upon the firſt guſt of the Storm that beats Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly upon him, falls down at the Feet of God, acknowledging his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity, and Adoring his Name. Well, in this Frame he met with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Tryals afterward, and how did he bear them, See, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the Patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very Pitiful and of tender Mercyes.</hi> In this Spirit he bear Affliction Patiently, and received Mercy Plentifully. God had two Deſigns on <hi>Job,</hi> to Try, and Bleſs him; and <hi>Job</hi>'s humble Spirit equally quallified him for both. Take <hi>David</hi> for a Second Example. By <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Rebellion he was brought to a great Strait, that muſt flye, to prevent the Surprize of his Perſon. Now take notice of his Frame, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>And the King ſaid unto</hi> Zadack <hi>carry back the Ark of God into the City: If I ſhall find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it and his Habitation. But if he ſay thus, I have no delight in thee, behold here I am, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him. David</hi> was not without hopes of being Reſtored to his Throne, and yet he had fears of the Contrary: but whether God would diſpoſe of him that way, or this; he Submits to his Pleaſure, Reſigns himſelf to his Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this prepared him for Suffering, and qualified him for Deliverance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.2. <hi>'Tis ſaid that God call'd</hi> Abraham <hi>to his Foot.</hi> (i. e.) to an intire Subjection to his Will: He diſputed nothing that God revealed, &amp; refuſed nothing which he commanded, what was this for? why! to fit him for great Tryalls &amp; Mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4. Cap. 22.1, 2, 3, —10 —16, 17, 18. this was <hi>Pauls</hi> Frame, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Frame is moſt fit to meet the Lord in the way of Judgment or Mercy which Chriſt choſe to ſuffer in, and ſo to enter into Glory. In the Text this was his caſe, he was ſhortly to meet with two Contrary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. He was to bear our Sin, and to Conflict with the Wrath of God for it; to Suffer the Violence of Hell, and the World, and to Dye an accurſed Death, but with all immediately, he is to be Glorified at the Right Hand of the Father. Both theſe he had in his Eye in this Chap. v. 23, 24. He expected a double Glory upon his Death: here, by the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, in Heaven, by the Exaltation of his humane Nature,
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:42587:356" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chap. 17.15. and both theſe he looked for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. Well, how will he prepare himſelf for Suffering and Glory? even by lying at his Fathers Foot in the Text. And now he can grapple with all his Enemys, and now he can wait for his reward, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.39, 42, 44. 'Twas in this Spirit that he went to meet his betrayer, v. 45, 46. This all the Evangeliſts mention for our Example. Certainly Chriſt knew what was the beſt preparation, for Judgment or Mercy, and Choſe it for himſelf, and was therein our Pattern.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thats the beſt way to meet God in the way of his Judgments or Mercies which himſelf preſcribeth, but a Reſigned humbled Spirit to his Will and Pleaſure is commanded by himſelf to qualify us for ſuch Diſpenſations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, and he ſhall Exalt you in due time.</hi> q. d. bear my Afflicting hand, and you ſhall feel my Supporting Exalting hand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That's the beſt Preparation for Mercy or Judgment which God aimeth at in Afflicting, and Rewardeth in Delivering his People: and this is a Reſigned Frame, an Obedient, Submiſs, Subdued Will to the Will of God. If he afflict his Children, 'tis becauſe they are Froward, if he Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them tis for the Compliance with his Pleaſure, <hi>Ephram</hi> was Smitten for his Stubborneſs, and Comforted for his Obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. God hath no Contention with us, but our Croſneſs: becauſe our Wills Thwart his, and our ways contradicts his; Firſt we reſiſt his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Will by Diſobedience, and then his chaſtizing Will by Impatience, and he in his Wiſdom and Love is reſolved to bring us to his Foot, Well! If we Comply before hand when we ſee the Storm approaching, God's end is Attained, and he either lay's down his Rod, or Mitigateth the Chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea he will e're long Embrace and Comfort broken and humble <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Indeed this Frame ſuperſeed's Affliction: for Judgment upon Saints are not to Deſtroy, but Subdue them to their Fathers Will. And if we meet our angry Father, in this Spirit; he may Correct a little, but he will certainly Comfort much.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, a reſigned Soul meeteth God in the way of Judgments or Mercies to great advantage. They are ſo far from doing him harm, that they do good, therefore it muſt needs be a bleſſed Preparation for either. Phyſick never works ſo well as when the Body is antecedently prepared: nor is any Perſon ſo certainly profited by Judgments or Mercies, as he that is ready to entertain them. I know God can do an unprepared Soul good by any Providence, but I am ſure none can come amiſs to ſuch as be prepared. What then will prepare us to receive Chaſtizments Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Be Subject to the Father of Spirits, and Live,</hi> Heb. 12.9. Comply with his Will, reſign your ſelves to his Pleaſure, and what ever he doth; will be a quickning in proving Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the Nature of this Reſignation to the Will of God for his Glory? Or wherein doth it conſiſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall reply to this Quere, by laying down ſomething imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and then ſpeak to the Proper Nature thereof. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:42587:357" rendition="simple:additions"/> many things, I ſhall Inſtance only in a few for Brevity's ſake</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſeth a Lively exerciſe of Faith. For as no Unbeliever ever did reſign himſelf freely to the Will of God: ſo no believer, if Faith be not in Exerciſe, can do it. Yea, it muſt be an active Faith will enable us to put our ſelves into the Hands of God (eſpecially in a Day of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to deal with us according to his Pleaſure. I ſay, that Soul muſt have a good Acquaintance with, and a bleſſed Confidence in him whom he truſteth with his Life and All. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore tells us, in caſe of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>he knew whom he had Truſted,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. Therefore our Saviour here, when he Referreth himſelf to God, expreſſeth his Faith in that very Reſignation. <hi>Father Glorify,</hi> &amp;c. He believed God to be his Father, and that his Father loved him, and now he is Satisfied that his Father diſpoſe of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.14, 15. <hi>But I truſted in thee Lord, I ſaid thou art my God.</hi> What then? <hi>my times are in thy Hands,</hi> q. d. 'tis not only thy Perogative to diſpoſe of me and my Days, but I refer them Voluntarily to thee. He put them into the hands of his God, and truſted them with him.</p>
            <p>There be many Perticulers that the Faith of a reſigned Soul is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in. As, <hi>That God is his God.</hi> Faith muſt have Intereſt in him whom it Truſteth. <hi>Iſaac</hi> will Suffer his Father to Bind and Sacrifice him, <hi>Why? Abraham</hi> was his Father, and God who had given the command for it was his God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. And it believes that all the will of God is Good. Good in it ſelf and good for the reſigned Soul. A believer may know that there may be Pain and Affliction in Suffering according to the Fathers Pleaſure: but 'tis withal aſſured, 'tis his good pleaſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. And ſuch a Soul believes, that it's God and Father, is kind, loving and tender, that he will not oppreſs, that he will not overwhelm. He believes that God Glorifies not himſelf to the damage of his People; but that his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their Benifit are inſeparably Linkt together. Yea, it is in Chriſt, the Redeemer of the Soul, putteth it ſelf into the Fathers Hands, and it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects Power and Strength from its God to bear the Sufferings and carry through them. When <hi>Moſes</hi> forſook <hi>Egypt</hi> and his Intereſt there, and choſe to Suffer Affliction with the People of God. He did <hi>this in Faith,</hi> Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>who is Inviſible,</hi> Heb. 12.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> in the like caſe was well Satisfied in the good will of God to him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15, 25, 26. Chap. 25. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſequently, 'tis an high act of Love. He that loves his Heavenly Father will be diſpoſed of by him, but it muſt be above becoming the glorious Objection, which it is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.37. A Love that prefers his Will and Glory before all things elſe. A Love in Compariſon of which all other Love is hatred, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. A Conſtraining love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>Abraham</hi> loved <hi>Iſaac</hi> well: why then did he offer him up at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God? O 'twas becauſe he loved God better. <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments, and nine of his Commandments are greivous,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.3. What, no Command greivous? Not Self-denial? not bearing the Croſs! No! Thoſe Commands are not greivous, becauſe the Soul loves God better then it ſelf. We have a great word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>They loved not their Lives unto Death,</hi> why, becauſe their love of
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:42587:357" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt, was ſtronger then Self-love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. We Read of ſome <hi>that followed the Lamb where ever he went.</hi> Into Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all ſorts they <hi>followed the Lamb,</hi> Why? <hi>Love conſtrained them,</hi> Chriſt therefore reſigned himſelf into the Fathers hands, for he loved his Father. Love will lay the Soul at Gods Feet, Love will follow and Obey the Fathers call in all things. Love will keep ſtedfaſtly in the way of the Will of our beloved. It argues little Love to Chriſt, when we ſeek to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Suffering for his Name, by finding out Carnal Shifts. He that loves the Father and Son is (as to the main) reſolved into their Will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To come nearer to my Intendment. This reſignation of our Wills to the Pleaſure of God for his Glory, reſpect's Sufferings and Dutys Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally. For there is no difficulty Ordinarily to comply with the good Will of God in Diſtributing Mercy and Favour. But to have our Wills Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into his, in caſe of difficult Duty, and hard Sufferings, which Croſs our corrupt Nature, and preſs upon our Pamper'd Fleſh; is a great Work, far above the Sphear, of an unregenerate Perſon, and a ſpecial Effect of the Spirit of God, in and upon the Hearts of Saints, But becauſe our Subject leads to conſider the matter, in caſe of Afflictions only: I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe thereto, Only adding this by the way, that where a Soul diſputeth no Sufferings, it Submits to all Dutys. If it be reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Will of the Lord in the one, 'tis Subjected to him in the other alſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore the Reſignation I ſpake of, conſiſts in ſeveral things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In referring our ſelves to the Will of God in a Day of Tryal, in the very things we fear. Our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> dreaded nothing like this Hour that was coming upon him. It troubled and amazed his very Soul, v. 27. glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would he be ſaved from it, had it been conſiſtent with his Fathers Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Honour: yet all this notwithſtanding he boweth his Soul, and prayeth his Father to <hi>Glorify his Name,</hi> ſo <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.39, &amp;c. His Soul trembled at the thoughts of the bitterneſs of that Cup; we find him not Relucting at any foregoing Suffering, but this amaz'd him as <hi>Mark</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, yet ſee his reſolve, <hi>nevertheleſs not my Will, but thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things in times of Trouble we uſually ſtart at, yet a reſigned Soul will refer it ſelf therein to the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter of the Tryal. Very oft we think we could be content to bear any burden, but what Providence lays upon us: carrying it as if God had pick't out the very worſt of Pains, and Aff ictions for us. We'd bear Sickneſs if it pleaſed God, but cannot away with Death, we'd lay down our Lives at Gods Feet, but know not to be confined in a naſty Goal. Let God ſend any thing but Poverty, or Baniſhment, or Slavery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The meaning of it is, we would Suffer according to our own Will, not Gods. For to corrupt Nature any Trouble is more Eligible, then what Providence fixeth upon. <hi>Rachel</hi> could Die more quietly (as ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) then endure the Affliction of Barrenneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1. Though, poor Woman, ſhe found that firſt as hard a Task as the ſecond, <hi>Chap.</hi> 35. 18.</p>
            <p>Was this Chriſts meaning when he prayed the Father to <hi>Glorify his
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:42587:358" rendition="simple:additions"/> Name?</hi> doth he preſcribe the Suffring or cloſe with his Fathers Pleaſure? did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay <hi>any Cup Father, but this,</hi> any Death, but this accurſed Crucifix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nay, but if <hi>this Cup may not paſs away, thy Will be done.</hi> O how far are we from this Frame, when we Complain, our Lot is worſe then any Mans. We think God hath choſen the Smarteſt Rod in all the Bundle for us. But where is our Reſignation all this while?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner of the Tryal, this is uſually diſputed. <hi>Saul</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare will Dye, but Scorns to be Slain by the uncircumciſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Abimeleck</hi> too, will Dye when he cannot help it, but not by the hand of a Woman, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.54. And we flatter our ſelves, as if we were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Glorify God by our Death; only we would chuſe the way of Dying. The meaning is, God ſhall be Glorified a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we pleaſe, He ſhall have the Honours but we'l preſcribe the manner. Indeed he owes us much thanks for our kindneſs. Is this to Glorify God? No! He is not Glorified but in the way of his Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Frame carrieth in it a Reſolution of our Suffering, not only into the Will of God, but his Glory alſo. O ſaith our bleſſed Lord, I'l Suffer thy Wrath, and Mens Malice &amp; Rage, and ſay thine be the Glory. I'l endure the Shame, and thou ſhalt have the Honour. <hi>Father Glorify thy Name.</hi> Chriſt ſtood not upon his own Credit, but the Fathers Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether therefore ye Eat or Drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Ye, whether ye Live or Dye, Suffer or Proſper, do all, Suffer all, for the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> A reſigned Soul counteth it worth his while to bear any Affliction, ſo God be Glorified. Our holy Lord here Ballanc't the Glory of God againſt his Sufferings; what a bleſſed Spirit was that of the <hi>Baptiſt? Jo.</hi> 3.30. <hi>I muſt decreaſe, but he muſt increaſe,</hi> he began to looſe his followers when Chriſt entred upon his Miniſtry: but inſtead of grudging at it, or envying him; he's aboundantly Satisfied; that his loſs was his Lords gain. A reſigned Soul will be baſe in its own Eyes; and be content to be vile in Mens Sight alſo, ſo God be Glorified. I know nothing more contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, then Affectation of Reputation to our ſelves: nor any thing more Chriſtian, then Zeal for, and deſire of, the Glory of God, and our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe who receive Honour one of another?</hi> Chriſt aimed at his Fathers Glory. Firſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have Glorified the upon Earth</hi> Here, both in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Suffering we muſt deſign Gods Glory, our turn comes not to have Glory till we be in Heaven. Nay! We muſt not only Aim at Gods Glory in our Suffering, but be willing that he mannage our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to that end. He always hath moſt Glory when he Orders the whole affair. Chriſt doth not ſay, Father <hi>I'l Glorify thy Name,</hi> but refers himſelf unto the Father, <hi>do thou O Father Glorify thy Name.</hi> Our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings bring God no Glory, unleſs he order them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Lo I come to do thy Will,</hi> there was nothing of the Will of Chriſt in the caſe, further then its Submiſſion to the Fathers Will, ſo muſt we lay our ſelves at the Feet of God, and deſire him to work out his own Glory in and by us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt alſo be willing that he make what Glory, for himſelf, he
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:42587:358"/> pleaſeth of us and by us. Some think from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. The Witneſſes would have finiſh't their Teſtimony too ſoon, and laid aſide the Sackcloth and Aſhes before the time. What know we, when God hath got Glory enough by our Sufferings? Nay let's be content to bear as long and as much as he thinketh fit, to be ſure we cannot Glorify him too much. Let him Carve for himſelf; when his Name hath had Glory enough by us, himſelf will eaſe us. Did Chriſt hang back after his Agony in the Garden? No! but thence he went to meet his apprehenders, thence to the Chief Prieſt, thence to Herod, and thence to Pilate again, then to the place of Execution, then to the Croſs, then to the Grave. He Suffered as long and as much as it was his Fathers Pleaſure. His Prayer in the Text, fixeth no meaſure nor Time, but leaveth the Stint to the Will of God. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> bare his ſeveral Afflictions Patiently, not one but all till God had done. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that he was not only <hi>ready to be Bound, but Dye, for the Name</hi> of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. And <hi>none of theſe things move me</hi> ſaith he, Chap. 20. 14. If when God hath Glorified himſelf by my Bonds, he thinks fit to get him Honour by my Death; I Submit. This ſhould check our impatience and wearineſs in a Suffering Day, how can we ſay, <hi>Father Glorify thy Name,</hi> when we would Stint him in the degree, and time of our Sufferings?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Frame, Submits the Seaſon when we ſhall Suffer, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wiſe Determination. This was the diſmalleſt hour that ever Chriſt ſaw: the <hi>Hour and Power of Darkneſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53.</note> when Hell and the World ſeemed to have all poſſible Advantages againſt the Lord. And doth he ſay <hi>Father ſave me from this Hour?</hi> yea! but he corrects himſelf, and with reſpect to that <hi>Hour</hi> puts up his requeſt to the Father in the Text, <hi>Father Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He is ſo far from contending about the Seaſon, that he came deſignedly to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at that time to Suffer, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.9, 10.</p>
            <p>But we are apt to Reluct in this caſe. O Lord deliver us from this and that Hour, and Glorify thy ſelf any time elſe. Some think <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was loath to Dye, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.23. Becauſe he was in the midſt of his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the work unfiniſht. He might poſſibly think it more ſon Gods Glory to live then, than Dye. Let <hi>me out live this Sickneſs,</hi> eſcape this Perſecution, avoyd this Judgment? and Father Glorify thy ſelf ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is our Language. But wher's Reſignation to the Will of God all this while? One would think, the Patriarks died very unſeaſonable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. When they expected the fulfilling of Promiſes, but however they died Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly. Many of us would gladly be ſpar'd, to ſee the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, the fall of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the return of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then they think they could ſay with <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2.29, 30. <hi>Lord now let thy Servant depart in Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe deſires are good, if attended with Submiſſion to the Will of God, otherwiſe Rebellious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though Nature ſhrinke, our Souls be perpext, our Thoughts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd for fear of the hour Approaching, yet our Wills muſt be Reſigned,
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:42587:359"/> our Reaſoning ſilenc't, our Paſſions Reſiſted, and all Submitted to the Will of God. The Lord Jeſus was now ſtrangely Perplext, fear and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazment ſtopt his Mouth for a while? yet as ſoon as he can Recollect himſelf, this is the Language both of Heart and Lips. <hi>Father Glorify thy Name.</hi> It may be we have Plauſible Arguments againſt Drinking the Cup, as <hi>our Weakneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3.</note> our <hi>Fear,</hi> and poſſibly, <hi>that to eſcape would be more for Gods Glory,</hi> that <hi>'tis an hard caſe, that we are not Ready,</hi> &amp;c. Well? but if we would have God Glorify himſelf, Reaſon muſt be ſilent, and only Faith ſpeak, as Chriſt doth in the Text, and <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.39, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Reſignation is not only a Thought, but a Deliberate deſire. 'Tis Chriſts requeſt to God? Nay! he begs more Hartily that the Father Glorify himſelf, then that he ſhould be ſaved from that Hour. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may now and then uſe ſuch an Expreſſion, by way of Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as a ſhort Prayer, the reſult of ſome cloſe Spiritual reaſoning in our Souls, but can we ſettle our deſire this way? can we ſay in time of Plague, Perſecution, or other Diſtreſs, <hi>Father Glorify,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord Jeſus knowing how much it conduced to the Fathers Glory, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to Suffer; but deſires it earneſtly and paſſionately, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>I have a Baptiſm to be Baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned, till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht.</hi> His Heart was bent, Bent to Glorify his Father, he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Angry with <hi>Peter</hi> for diſwading, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.22, 23. He ſpaks; with an Holy Paſſionateneſs and Indignation, <hi>Jo.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The Cup that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putteth into my Hands, ſhall I not Drink it?</hi> And this is recorded for our Imitation, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. <hi>What mean you to Weep, and breake my Heart, I am ready,</hi> &amp;c. was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit. The Name and Glory of the Lord Jeſus, are concerned in my Sufferings, and I will Suffer his Will. We ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not only to be Content, but deſirous of Suffering, when it is for the Glory of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly. This is Chriſts laſt and Final Reſolve, he was at firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant, but now he fixeth, and Changed not till Death. Ah! many of us may ſay now and then, <hi>Father Glorify thy Name,</hi> but our Spirit alters, <hi>Our goodneſs is as a Morning Cloud, early dew, that ſoon Vaniſheth, Hoſ.</hi> 13.3. O but a reſigned Soul makes it his abiding Reſolve.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next General is to Alledg ſome grounds on which this Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Built, and reaſons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We cannot preſcribe how God ſhould be Glorified, therefore 'tis fit we be Reſigned. How have Men befooled themſelves and diſhonoured God in the caſe of Worſhip? They'l invent and preſcribe Forms and Modes, when they have no ground to believe he'l accept them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſeth God but his own Will. Even in the caſe in hand we muſt not diſpoſe of our Selves, and Suffer how, and when, and where, and by whom we pleaſe; for this would rather diſhonour then Credit the cauſe of God; becauſe it wholy depend's upon his Pleaſure. He hath laid the Whole Platform and contrivance thereof in his own Councels and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and therein all the ſeveral Spirits of the Myſtery anſwer, and add Beauty to each other. Now any thing of our Will, would deform the
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:42587:359" rendition="simple:additions"/> reſt, and take off from that Divine Symmatry and Concord which render all, becomming the Wiſdom, Holineſs, Power, and Soveraign Grace of God. And why do we not as well teach him? how he ſhould Govern the World, as how he ſhould diſpoſe of us! would it be for Gods Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if we ſhould direct when it ſhould Rain, and when Shine, when there ſhould be a Storm, and when a Calm? He that underſtands not the whole Councel of God, cannot direct any Fragment thereof, <hi>who hath known the Mind of the Lord and who hath been his Councellor?</hi> Rom. 11.34. Nay is it not moſt diſhonourable, that his Creatures ſhould adviſe him? that duſt and aſhes ſhould correct his Will, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9, 10. The way of Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the way of his Pleaſure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. Into which, unleſs we reſolve our ſelves, we obſtruct his Honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe Gods Glory is moſt Valuable; Chriſt ſtood not upon his Life, in Compariſon of his Fathers Glory, what then is our Life, or Eaſe or Credit, to be laid in the bottom with it? Better the World Periſh, then God not be Glorified? It was made for his Pleaſure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. for that end is it continued, and if it be diſſolved, that will be the deſign, ſee how magnificently the Prophet ſpeaks of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15, 16, 17. And ſhall nothing, ſhall we ſtand between him and his Glory? Methinks we ſhould Tremble at our unwillingneſs to Suffer according to his Will, conſidering how it Eclipſes his Glory? <hi>Joſhua</hi> was more Solicitous for Gods Name, than his own Life, or all the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Joſ. 7.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt hath ſhew'd us the way in this moſt difficult caſe. <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for I am Meek and Lowly,</hi> Matt. 11.29. Wherein did he expreſs his Meekneſs, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.3, 7. He neither refuſed nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, complained, nor reſiſted. He behaved himſelf moſt Submiſly and Obediently. Now learn of him: lay down Paſſion, and tumult in a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering day, and lye at the feet of your Father, what did the Lord Submit, and may the ſervant Rebel? <hi>Nay, the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant</hi> as his Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Matt. 10.24. <hi>'Tis enough to be like him. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was content to Dye if God pleaſed, why? <hi>I am not better then my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 1 Kings 19.4. Did the example of the Patriarcks move him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a greater then the Patriarks is here.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe God hath had his Will and Glorified his Name hitherto: ſo he ſaith immediately after our Text.</p>
            <p>And muſt Providence be put out of its Courſe for us! did not God Glorify himſelf upon, and by all our Predeceſſors in all Ages? The greateſt, the holyeſt of them, gave way to the Courſe of his Will, they were ſick, impriſon'd, poor, ſtrangers, Perſecuted and Slain, when, by whom, and as he pleaſed; and what are we, a fooliſh Generation, ariſen in this laſt and worſt Age; that we ſhould reluct, or murmur, or tumultuate, or be angry or impatient? <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto,</hi> &amp;c. He had not been impeded in his Providential will to that day; nor is he yet. And is it ſit he ſhould alter his courſe for us, now at laſt? This is the Fathers own Argument.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe do what we can, he will Glorify his Name, ſo himſelf ſaith
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:42587:360" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the words following, <hi>I will Glorify it again.</hi> Friends, 'tis fit we conſider this matter, when God call's to Suffering, this is the Language of non-ſubmiſſion: <hi>We will not be perſecuted, we will not be Impriſoned,</hi> &amp;c. but what ſaith God, <hi>I will,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, he will do it in ſpite of us.</p>
            <p>He did not ask our Leave to make us, nor will he, to diſpoſe of us. <hi>Non-reſignation</hi> imply's a double Contradiction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To God, <hi>I will do all My Will, my Councel ſhall ſtand</hi> in his reſolve. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. No ſaith an unreſigned Soul, <hi>I will not, I cannot bear it, it muſt not be, at leaſt for this once.</hi> Vain man! what would become of the World, yea of the Church; if Gods Will were not fixt, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.1. The providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God are repreſented by Chariots: ſome <hi>Red,</hi> importing War, ſome <hi>Black,</hi> expreſſing Famine, ſome <hi>Grizled</hi> &amp; <hi>Bay,</hi> ſignifiing Vanity of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, others <hi>White,</hi> denoting Peace and Comfort. Well, all this proceeds <hi>from two Mountains of Braſs,</hi> denoting the irreverſible Councels of God. Go to then vain Man, if thou will not bear War, or Famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtop the Chariots, ſtay their Career if thou canſt; or lead them out of their way, but know thou muſt firſt remove the Mountains of Braſs, and change Gods Eternal unalterable Councells. Pray is it not better to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly, then ſtruggle in vain? Take heed leaſt the more thou ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, thou be the more intangled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.20. Never was any thing got by Reſiſtance, of the Will of God, ſave Blows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To our ſelves, and this is as abſurd, as the other is Vain and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical. Have we Prayed all our Days that the Will of God be done? If we have not, we are Strangers to Prayer, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.10. If we have then by refuſing to Submit to the Will of God in Suffering times, we contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves. Now what an abſurdity is it to deſire God to do his Will, and refuſe to ſubmit when he brings his good Pleaſure upon us? Is this fair dealing, doth it become reaſonable Creatures, or Chriſtians, may we ſay, and unſay, deſire, and deny, the ſame things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But we did not think of Suffering, when we put up that Petition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And do we Pray we know not, or regard not what? is this to pray in Faith? Is it an Affront to God to vent a Prayer to him, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſenſe or meaning of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> We were of that Mind then, but fear of Suffering hath altered our Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And muſt God change his Will, as oft as we vary ours?</p>
            <p>This were to make him more changeable than our ſelves, for whereas we only alter our minds as we think fit, we would have God change as we pleaſe, and ſo make our Wills, the rule of His.</p>
            <p>Beſides what we pray Diliberately we ought to reſolve for ever, or elſe our Praying is Lightneſs. To which let me add; that when Chriſt gave that directory of Prayer, he left it as a ſtanding Rule never to be varyed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe God is our <hi>Father,</hi> therefore we muſt acquieſs in his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This is our Lords Argument Couch't in the Text. <hi>Father Glorify thy Name,</hi> q. d. I Submit to my Fathers Will, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.11. <hi>The Cup that
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:42587:360" rendition="simple:additions"/> my Father giveth me, ſhall I not Drink it?</hi> Is it becoming our Relation to withſtand our Fathers Will and Glory? Would you take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> well, if your Children ſhould Rebel, and refuſe your Correction? And how do you think your Heavenly Father will take your Reſiſtance againſt his? Poor Worms that we are, there's no Proportion between their Diſobedience to us, and ours to God. When <hi>Saul,</hi> though a King, Rebelled againſt the Command of God, 'tis compared to the <hi>Sin of Witchcraft,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. He gave us our Being, Lives, and all we have, and ſhall he not diſpoſe them? may he not do what he will with his own, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20, 15. can we, or any thing we injoy, be better improved then for our Fathers Glory. <hi>Of him, and from him, and to him, are all things; to him be Glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Father is our Superiour, 'tis fit therefore we be reſigned to his Will, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20, 12. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> How much more our Heavenly Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 9. See <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit in the caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.12. q. d.

And yet he was of Age and Strength Sufficient to have ſtrugled for his Life, being Twenty five Years old. But that holy young man abhorred the thoughts of ſtriving with his Father. And ſhall not we reſign our ſelves to our God and Father in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Father is Wiſer then we, therefore we ſhould reſt in his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhall we who are but of <hi>Yeſterday and know nothing,</hi> contradict the wiſe diſpoſal of the Ancient of days, the only wiſe God? <hi>my Father</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaac,) her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> This is an hard ſaying who can hear it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. 'Tis hard to untamed, wanton, Proud Nature, to make the Will of God our Rule, and deny our own Wills, but then how hard will Suffering be without it? An unreſign'd Soul in a day of Affliction, is like <hi>a wild Bull in a Net full of the Fury of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the troubled Sea that cannot reſt, but caſteth forth Mire and Dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But it is eaſie to a gratious Soul, as ſuch. Grace in the Heart is the Image of God, and this Image mainly conſiſts in the Conformity of the Will, to Gods VVill. The Scripture call's it, <hi>writing his Law in the Heart and putting it in the inward parts, Jer.</hi> 31.33. VVell? and what is the proper natural Effect, or reſult hereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. It makes the Soul not only Obedient in Suffering, but to Submit with <hi>Delight.</hi> Now none of Gods Commands, nothing of his Will, Scriptural, or providential, is greivous, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence I infer that God is not Glorified but in his own way, for our VVills muſt be reſigned to, and reſolved into his. If he will that we Suffer, 'tis vain to dream of Honouring him otherwiſe, ſuppoſe we reſove to ſave our ſelves, and make him amends by double and treble Duty, we decieve our ſelves. <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of Lambs,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22. All the Manifeſtative Glory of God, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on his VVill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. VVe may extol his Power, Grace, Juſtice, Holineſs, &amp;c. and not give him Glory, if in the interim we reſiſt his VVill, tis vain to think of Honouring God, and doing our own VVill, give him all but his VVill, and we give him nothing. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His great deſign is his VVill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. He both contriveth, and Executeth according to it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. All his word is but his VVill, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 1.9. Truth is the Analagy of perſons, things, word and thoughts unto the VVill of God. And this is his great Contraverſy with men in the VVorld, they'd have their VVill, and he will have His And indeed Sin is only (and that's enough and too much) a Contradiction of his VVill, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.4. And the accompliſhment of his VVill is his Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In relucting againſt his VVill, we contend againſt all his Name and being. 'Tis a denial of his Soveraignty and perogative, for what is that but his Pleaſure. We thwart his decrees, for they are the <hi>Purpoſe of his Will.</hi> VVe contradict his Power thereby, as if he were notable to do his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, many are our oppoſitions, we thereby Disbeleive his Holineſs, as if his Will were not good, and his Wiſdom, as if he had not ordered his matters accurrately, yea, we deny his Juſtice by reſiſting his VVill; as if he required more then his due. Indeed his VVill is the hinge upon which all his Attributes move, diſappoint it, and you ſupplant them all, ſo abſolutely doth his Glory depend upon his Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I infer, that Gods Glorifiing his Name by our Sufferings is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his Parternal Relation. <hi>Father Glorify thy Name.</hi> If he be our Father, then he Loves, then he Careth for us, when he Afflicteth us. For nothing can deprive us of the Comfort of this Relation, which is conſiſtent with that Relation. Chriſt in his Agony calls him Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39.
<pb n="919" facs="tcp:42587:361" rendition="simple:additions"/> When he was betrayed and apprehended, <hi>Jo.</hi> 18.11. When he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs his expreſſion implies as much, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. And he ſaith no more, when he was Riſen, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> There is not the ſame Reaſon, why God ſhould continue our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Suffering, as that he ſhould be Chriſt in his Paſſion. Becauſe he is his Eternal Son, we only adopted Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection proves only that Chriſt hath the firſt Right to his Paternity, and we only ſecundarily in him, but not that he is leſs conſtantly our Father then his, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. Though we be but adopted Sons, our Adoption is Endleſs not Temporary. And therefore our Father will be our Father in Affliction, and we ſhall be his Children. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Fatherly Love is the Reaſon of his Chaſtizements. He would not Scourge and Correct his Childeren, but becauſe they are his Childeren. He Chaſtizeth them as a Father, he Condemneth others, as a Judge. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are Heirs of his precious promiſes even in Affliction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. It ſeems then his Faithfulneſs to his word of promiſe is engag'd, when we are Tempted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suffering Saints have the Image of their Father when they Suffer, Chriſts Sufferings were conſiſtent with the Clouding of his Divine Nature, then it did not appear in its Glory; but not with the ſeperation of it from his Humane. Saints may be <hi>Black</hi> by Affliction, but withal they are <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> by grace, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They then ſtand in moſt need of his Fatherly Care and Love, and therefore ſhall not be deprived thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12. &amp; 43.23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Sonſhip dependeth on Chriſts Sonſhip: if therefore God were his Father in his Sufferings, he will be our Father in ours. For we are choſen, and predeſtinated in Chriſt to the Adoption of Sons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. This is the Reaſon why Sin it ſelf cannot Un-ſon us, becauſe we are Adopted in Chriſt, not for our own Sake, but his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. While we ceaſe not to be Chriſt's Members, we ceaſe not to be the Fathers Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if God be our Father why doth he Suffer his Children to be ſo abuſed in the World? Can it conſiſt with the Love of our Father to ſee his Children Impriſoned and Slain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before his Face, and he not help and ſave them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> It is enough that the Scripture hath Reconciled theſe things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, &amp;c. We may as well ſay, how could the Father Love Jeſus Chriſt, yet Bruiſe him in that dreadful manner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7, 8, 9, 10. But I add,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That be the Saints never ſo dear to their Father, yet his own Name and Glory is more Dear. Their Sufferings being for his Glory, he'l there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore permit them. Is it fit that he Suffer in his Name, rather then we in our Fleſh? Or muſt he looſe his Glory, to preſerve our Eſtates, Eaſe, Liberty, or Lives. Nay faith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Father Glorifie thy
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:42587:362" rendition="simple:additions"/> Name,</hi> do any thing with me, rather than neglect thy Glory: and ſee the Fathers anſwer in the following words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be his Love to his Saints never ſo great, his hatred of Sin, and his juſt Indignation againſt it are as great. Now here lyes the caſe, ſhe muſt either Chaſtize as for our Sins, or be unjuſt. He muſt either diſpence ſo far with his Love, as to correct us, or diſpence with his Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. And judge now which is moſt like a Father, to correct a Sinning Child, or Pamper him in Sins? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence I infer, that our Peace, Eaſe, joy, Eſtates, Liberty, and Life, are Subordinated, and muſt be Submitted to the Will and Glory of God. Be ſure Chriſt, put theſe things in their proper place, and behold his Life and all are reſolved into the Fathers Will and Glory. Nor did he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue himſelf or them, in laying them at his Fathers Feet. Certainly he was moſt tender of that, which was moſt Valuable. All the Baptiſt's Credit was to Vaniſh at Chriſts appearing upon the Stage. VVell did he Buſtle in his own behalf? Nay he bare witneſs that he that came after him, was to be preferred before him, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.15. and being demanded who he was; <hi>he confeſſed and denyed not, but confeſſed I am not the Chriſt,</hi> v. 20. VVhat need all this? but that <hi>John</hi> was render of the order wherein God had plac't him. So v. 27. O that it were thus with us? that we would lay down our Selves, our Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the Feet of God, and ſubordinated them to his Glory? That we were willing that he be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified though we Suffer.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Be we never ſo great and high, yet our Father muſt do his Pleaſure with us, and get Glory by us. Though <hi>Chriſt were a Son, yet he Learned Obedience,</hi> Heb. 5.8. Yea he was <hi>Equal with the Father in Nature,</hi> Phil. 2.6. Yet having Covenanted to be the Fathers Servant in the Mediatory Diſpenſation, <hi>he made himſelf of no Reputation,</hi> &amp;c. v. 7, 8. O <hi>let this mind be in us, which was alſo in Chriſt,</hi> v. 5. How was God pleaſed with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Reſignation of his Son, his only Son, the Son of his Love of his Age, his Darling Child. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12, 15, 16, 17, 18. VVell? as great as any of us think our ſelves, we are not ſo great as Chriſt, not ſo Conſiderable as <hi>Abraham,</hi> let us be Content God ſhould Glorifie himſelf by making us little and laying us low in the VVorld. VVhat an abaſement was it to Chriſt to be ſold for 30 Peices of Silver? See what himſelf ſaith of it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12, 13. <hi>a goodly Price, that I was Prized at of them,</hi> yet he could bear in Submiſſion to his Father. O that high, proud, lofty, State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profeſſors, who ſtand upon their greatneſs, who affect grandeur would conſider this! Certainly the hight of Chriſtians is a great part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy God hath with us in this Day. Pray lets bow our Spirits, and lour our Top-ſails willingly, for God is bringing us down, and (for any thing I know) he cannot otherwiſe have his VVill and Glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5 See hence whither we muſt drive our perplexitys in Suffering, if we would Conquer them even to this Holy Reſignation of our ſelves into the Soveraign VVill of God.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus came to no Compoſure till he arrived at this Frame.
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:42587:362" rendition="simple:additions"/> Compare with the Text, the foregoing verſe. As long as you reluct againſt Providence, expect nothing but Tumult: <hi>He reſiſteth the proud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 4.6, 7. who ſo proud, as the unreſigned Soul? Well, if we ſubmit not, God will fight againſt us, and judge what compoſure we can then have. When <hi>Jonah</hi> oppoſed the Lords Will, had he any reſt? chap. 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Job.</hi> 9.4. 'till we reſign, he'l viſit our Souls with darkneſs, our Bodies with pain, and our Matter with fruſtration and diſappointment. A Man that will Swim againſt Tyde, and Stream, and Wind, may waſte and ſpend his ſtrength; but the longer he ſtrives, the more unfeaſable his Attempt is. So while you ſtrive againſt the Lords pleaſure, expect univerſal diſturbance; For when the debate is who ſhall yeild, whether God ſhall abate his Will or we ſubmit ours: we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive, how bitter, unquiet, and vexatious, the greateſt will be on our part. Well, but come, and reſign to the Will of God, and all will be calm, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.15. There are three things herein exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our ſpirits and thoughts are now come to a concluſion, before there was a conteſt between Grace and Nature; that would, this would not, ſubmit: this created unquietneſs, but now Grace hath got the day, the Soul is calm. When there are two Armies in the Feild Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all is in a cumbuſtion: but when one is conquered, Peace enſueth. That which created Chriſt's trouble, was the ſtruggle between his Natural and Divine Will. Now that being concluded by reſignation, he is at reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now there's no difficulty in our way, for we follow provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Having reſign'd, the burden of our ſuffering is roll'd upon God. A reſigned Soul caſteth it ſelf into his Arms, as well as ſubmits to his Will; and now God is engaged, if not to ſave us from the hour, yet to help us in and through it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Let me adviſe the people of God, to take this courſe. If we muſt ſuffer Impriſonment, loſs of Goods, or Liberty, or Life, let Providence find us in this frame. Well then, let's be earneſt with God, and contend with our own ſpirits till we come to this temper, till we can in ſome bleſſed meaſure ſay with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Father glorifie thy Name.</hi> Friends, it may be this Doctrine, and Exhortation, will find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight entertainment with ſome: but I will promiſe them they cannot meet God in the way of his judgments in any other frame. If the Lord Jeſus would not venture upon his Agony till he had attained it, how ſhall we be able to meet our ſufferings without it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Tis true this was the frame of Chriſt: but is it poſſible for us to attain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, it is feaſable. It was not peculiar to Chriſt: but tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to his Member, with him. I have given ſeveral inſtances: nor doth God oblige us unto impoſſibilities. There are two things I have to ſay in the caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="922" facs="tcp:42587:363"/>1. God gives this reſignation ſometimes unexpectedly. If he ſurprize an holy Soul with affliction, he'l ſometimes ſurprize it with ſubmiſſion and reſignation. Nay, every Believer in ſuffering for the Name and Cauſe of God, hath the promiſe of the Spirit, to compoſe and carry him through, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.11. Obſerve, this promiſe takes place in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what then? <hi>Take no thought what ye ſhall ſpeak.</hi> We muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine this promiſe to the Spirits management of our Tongues only; nay, it extends much more to our Hearts and Thoughts. If the Spirit dictate our words, how much more will it influence our Souls? And I add, the Lord doth not ſay it ſhall be given before hand, but in that Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Spirit of reſignation is ordinarily the Bleſſing of Exerciſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2. As in all other Caſes Grace is given in and upon our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.2. ſo in this Caſe. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do what you can to clear up your intereſt in God. This once cleared, ſubmiſſion is in a manner eaſie. Why did <hi>Iſaac</hi> reſign himſelf to his Father? <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. becauſe he knew he was his Father. <hi>My Father</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jophtha</hi>'s Daughter) <hi>if thou haſt opened thy mouth to the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth,</hi> Jud. 11.36. A dutiful Child will not, dare not, cannot prophane it's Relation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with its Father. Upon this Principle our Lord Chriſt built his reſignation in the Text. 'Tis impoſſible to ſubmit willingly to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an Enemy. Enmity excludes ſubmiſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. let there be a ſenſe of reconciliation, and reſignation will follow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt be exerciſed in the mortification of pride and paſſion. For pride will ſwell, and paſſion tumultuate; they who are uſed to have their wills, ſhall find it hard, if not impoſſible, to let God have his without reluctancy. No, ſelf-will, will tumultuate againſt God himſelf according to cuſtom. You know how it was with peeviſh <hi>Jonah. I do well to be angry,</hi> with proud <hi>Joram; this evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait upon him any longer?</hi> And how with <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 5.2. they were perſons uſed to have their wills. When the Devil deſired God to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 1. 11. &amp; 2. 5 he preſumed, that <hi>Job</hi> having had much proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, could not bear a great croſs without flying in God's Face. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we have been inured to ſufferings, the Task is eaſier yet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27, 28. <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſtomed to afflictions, and ſee what he ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Keep the ſenſe of your own great ſinfulneſs upon your hearts. This will ſtop your mouths when you would complain of the holy hand of God upon you, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39. <hi>wherefore doth a living man complain, I will bear the indignation of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Church elſewhere) <hi>becauſe I ſinned againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Chriſt pray'd himſelf into this frame, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12.27, 28. The more impatient and diſcontent we be, the more need of Prayer. Chriſt did not tarry till the hurry were over, but cryed to his Father while it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. And obſerve, How he Prayed, and what? He Prayed brokenly,
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:42587:363" rendition="simple:additions"/> and uttered the Senſe and very Caſe of his Soul. No matter how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubt the Prayer be, ſo it be the Repreſentation of our Hearts. Thus did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 61.2. Where doth he Pray? in Baniſhment. When? when his Spirit is overwhelmed. How doth he Pray? he Cried. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> Prayed her ſelf, compoſed. Remember Reſignation is the work of the Spirit of God; and therefore you muſt plead for it before you have it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Subdue your Carnal Reaſonings by the Reaſonings of Faith. So did Holy <hi>David,</hi> when the Fleſh had Reaſoned him into Impatience, he went into the Sanctuary; and was compoſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17. And to help in this Combat between Faith and Senſe: take theſe following Conſiderations,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all things are good from Gods Will. I am ſure all Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be. They are good becauſe he Willeth them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68. <hi>Thou art good, and thou doeſt good.</hi> Himſelf is good, and Will; therefore are his ways good alſo. No matter what Senſe and Reaſon ſay: God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do amiſs. And therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> lays down this as a Principle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dare Argue about Gods Judgments, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1. And ſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 73.1. So <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That what becomes God to do, or order, becomes us to ſuffer. If God bring the Affliction we may bear it. If it be for his Glory, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be for our Diſadvantage. God will not do what is Evil; and we may very well ſubmit to what is good, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis our Folly and Bruitiſhneſs when there is any Impatience of Gods Will. <hi>Jonah</hi> was Mad with Paſſion, when he told God he did well to be Angry, at the Dying of the Guord, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God hath managed as unlikely Providences for the good of his People, as theſe that he is bringing upon us; and having ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs, 'tis reaſon we ſubmit; eſpecially having the Promiſe too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 28.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That when there is a contrariety of Will between Two Parties, the Beſt, the Wiſeſt, the Holieſt, ſhould carry it. If either God muſt not have his Will, or we want ours. 'Tis all the reaſon in the World we ſhould ſubmit, and imbrace the Croſs patiently. Methinks there ſhould be no Debate about this matter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That God will be Glorified, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. This ſilenc'd <hi>Aaron,</hi> and what are we? This was Anſwer enough to Chriſt himſelf in the Text; and are we too good, or too proud to acquieſce in it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That God is Glorified upon others on harder Terms then any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us. Our Cup is nothing ſo bitter as the Lord Jeſus's was, nor like that of the Primitive Chriſtians and Martyrs, then and ſince. They were ſcourg'd with Scorpions, we, in compariſon, but with ſmall Rods.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, That ſubmiſſion breaks the Blow: God will not contend with a reſigned Soul. <hi>Satis eſt proſtraſſe.</hi> But his Day falls heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="924" facs="tcp:42587:364"/> the Unquiet, Proud and Obſtinate. <hi>With the froward he will behave himſelf frowardly.</hi> Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>As Incouragements to Reſignation: Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This frame is a greater Bleſſing then Deliverance, Chriſt choſe it rather, then that the Cup ſhould paſs away. And the Father rather granted it. Certainly what the Father and Son preferred, is beſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This once attain'd, Sufferings are Free-will-offerings. Now Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not an Abſolute Neceſſity, but the Souls Choice. And what an Honour is it to be willing perſons in ſuch an hard caſe? <hi>If we ſubmit willingly we have a Reward: if not, a neceſſity of ſuffering however lies upon us,</hi> to allude to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16, 17. <hi>David</hi> acknowledged that God put a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Honour upon him and his People, when they offered willingly, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.14. How much greater Honour is it, to offer our ſelves to the pleaſure of God in a ſuffering-ſeaſon?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is evidently the Duty of the Day. Fear is on every ſide. The Fury of Bruitiſh Men is very high, many of our Brethren are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready oppreſt, and bear it quietly. God calls us to reſignation to his Will in all Providences, and aloud by the Voice of his Word? And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge fails us: Why? that we may have no poſſibility of Evading this Duty. And being its now ſeaſonable it ſhould be beautiful and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our Eyes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we reſign to the Will of God, Faith ſhall be kept alive, and our hold of our relation to, and intereſt in, God continued. Chriſt in the height of his Sufferings could call God <hi>his God:</hi> and commit his Spirit confidently into his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we ſurvive and out-live the Storm, God will make us eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Veſſels of Honour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. What great perſons were <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> after they had reſolved themſelves into the Will of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, &amp;c. Nay, the benifit thereof extended to their Poſterity for many Generations. What a bleſſed end had patient reſigned <hi>Job? James</hi> 5.11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we Die in this Frame, and Day, according to the Will of God, it ſhall be no loſs, but infinite advantage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1, 2. See it in <hi>David,</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. After <hi>Paul</hi> had ſubmitted himſelf to the Will of God, and the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. &amp; 21.13. How confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was he at his Diſſolution, and in what a Tryumphant Frame do we find him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. When proud, unbroken, impatient Souls, Suffer and Die in Dread and Horrour: the reſigned Chriſtian ſhall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Peace and Confidence.</p>

               </bibl>
               <q>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul? And why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet Praiſe him, who is the health of my Countenance, and my God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p n="1">1. UPon the Propoſal of this Caſe to me, I rather choſe this Text than that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. becauſe I thought God and our ſelves were both to be conſidered, in the juſt reſolution of the Caſe before us; for we muſt as well look within, as above our ſelves, and accordingly here we ſee, that <hi>David</hi>'s firſt look was into himſelf; and then his next look was towards his God. So that I thought this Text moſt ſuited to the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When, and upon what occaſion this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was Penned, I will not now enquire into: but when ever it was, <hi>David</hi> was then under black diſpenſations of Divine Providence, and under dreadful Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Spirit, and put very ſeverely to it, how to Encourage and Support himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Text may be conſidered. 1. As an Hiſtory of. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> troubles and afflictions. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> Sence and temper of Spirit under them, and concerning them 3. Of the Courſe he took to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 2. As a Doctrine, to teach Gods Saints and Servants. 1. To what they are liable. 2. And by what and how they are to be relieved and ſupported. 3. As a Directory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Text then we have obſervable. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> ſelf Arraignment for immoderate deſpondencies and dejections under the preſent hand of God upon him. <hi>Why caſt down? And why diſquieted within me?</hi> 2. His ſelf Encouragement and Inſtruction: <hi>Hope thou in God.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="5">5. So that you ſee, <hi>David.</hi> 1. Cites himſelf to his own Court, to account for his own diſquietments and dejection, and here his ſcrutiny is

And I do hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that I ſhall have Opportunity and a Call for to Praiſe [acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and adore] him, in the Solemnities of his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Let me then conſider theſe words as they relate unto <hi>David;</hi> and give us the Hiſtory of <hi>Davids</hi> Excerciſe and Self-Relief. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Patient or Afflicted Perſon was Holy <hi>David.</hi> A Man after Gods own Heart: Enamoured on God; devoted to him, delighted in him, conſtant and chearful in his attendencies on God; exceeding ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and obſervant of all Divine approaches to him, and Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Retreats from him, Thirſting and Panting greatly after the Solaces and Entertainments of Gods Houſe and Altars; and bitterly lamenting the loſs and abſence of thoſe Solemnities wherein he formerly had ſo copiouſly and frequently pleaſed himſelf: afflicted mightily with thoſe deriſions and reproaches which reflected ſo ſeverely upon God through him, though nothing could ſour or abate his adoring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful thoughts of God; yet it ſtruck him to the heart to hear Men always ſaying, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> Add hereunto, that <hi>David</hi> was a King, a Prophet, a type of Chriſt, a Man of vaſt experiences and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch a peculiar Favourite to God, as that he was encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to more than ordinary expectations from him, of which he had great Seals and Earneſts, and yet we ſee, he could not be excuſed from great Storms and Agonies, and Anxieties of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which this good Man underwent, was a great dejection and diſquietment in his own Spirit, by reaſon of ſome great afflictions that befel him. Gods Providence toucht him in his deareſt and moſt valuable Mercies; for he was an exile from Gods Altars, Gods great Enemies toucht him in that which lay neareſt to his Heart; for they Reproacht him with his God, and conſequently, with and for all his religious Hopes and Duties: thus ſtriking at his God through him. All this afflicted him the more, in that hereby great jealouſies and ſuſpicions were ariſing of Gods deſerting him, and diſmal fears and thoughts of Gods having hid his face from him. And he ſaw no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood in the poſture and preſages of ſecond Cauſes, that ever it would be better with him. And hence his Spirit was<note place="margin">

<pb n="927" facs="tcp:42587:365" rendition="simple:additions"/> of all Compoſures, Strength, and Comforts. His Paſſions, they were apt to mutiny: his confidences, to decay, and wither; and the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Spirit to decline. Sorrows encompaſt him like a Cloud, preſt him down like a great Burthen; bound him down like a Chain; came in upon him like a Flood: and ruſht in on him, like a diſſolute and ſurpriſing Hoſt. And very difficult he found it to keep up his Religion in its juſt Reputation with himſelf, whilſt thus afflicted in it, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Courſe he takes to help himſelf is this. 1. He ſurveys his troubles, and takes the exact demenſions of them, obſerving what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and effects they had upon his own Spirit, and 2. He takes his Soul to task about them, as being 1. Fitteſt to reſolve the Caſe. 2. Every way reſponſible and accountable for his reſentments and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and for the impreſſions and effects of troubles. 3. Moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſelf correction, inſtruction and encouragement, and conſequently, of ſelf redreſs, and moſt concerned therein. And 4. As that which muſt be active too. <hi>David</hi> was confident of help from God: and this his confidence is quickned and kept up by Arguments and Pleas: He knew no help could be expected any where, but in and from God. And he concludes and argues, that God could work and give it, becauſe he was <hi>the God,</hi> and that he would conſider him in mercy, becauſe he was <hi>his God.</hi> And theſe things muſt be remembred, argued and revived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Soul, and were ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And with his own conſiderate and religious Soul this matter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated here. What! <hi>Davids</hi> Soul? my Soul? <hi>A Soul,</hi> and therefore great in its Original, Capacity and End! A <hi>Gracious</hi> Soul, and therefore near and dear to God, encouraged by his promiſes and providence, to truſt him, ſerve him, and to cleave to him: What! <hi>Davids Soul,</hi> fitted for God, and for ſelf management, converſes and improvements! Why ſhould this Soul be thus diſquieted and caſt down? He was not ſo vain and idle, as to expect relief from Heaven, by ſo engaging God for him, as to neglect himſelf, inward, as well as other work muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Obſerve the manner of his d ſcourſing with himſelf, it is <hi>expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> He cites, and challenges, ſearches, and chides himſelf, and hints theſe things unto himſelf. That 1. Something was attended to that it ſhould not. 2. Some thing was not attended to, that ſhould. 3. That therefore all ought to be ſet and kept right as to his inward thoughts and ſentiments with reference to his preſent Caſe and Cure. 4. And that becauſe miſtakes and raſhneſs in ſuch important matters, are dangerous and ſinful in their tendency, conſequences and effects. Hence then, 1. He obſerves his preſſures, and the temper and behaviour of his Spirit under them: and he finds ſome trucklings of Spirit which he diſlikes and wonders at. 2. He is Solicitous to know the moſt that can be found, alledged, and urged, to countenance and juſtifie theſe diſquietments and dejections. 3. All this be ſearches after in order to a fair and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:42587:366" rendition="simple:additions"/> Tryal; and in this Tryal he concludes that nothing objected can hold weight. 4. He is aware of other things that are to be produced for the ſuppreſſion and rebuke of his dejectedneſs, and for the revival and encouragement of his Soul, through hope in God. 5. Theſe things he is ready and willing to produce and urge; and ſo, to adjuſt the whole concern. And 6. Hereupon he drives the thing up to its utmoſt height; and turns a faithful and impartial ſelf cenſurer and inſtructour; that ſo, he may not be buffeted in the dark, and prove a ſinful Inſtrument in his own dejections and diſtreſs; nor he baffled by theſe his Sorrows.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His Self-arraignment and Diſcourſes being finiſhed thus, he now proceeds to Self-inſtruction and Encouragement, <hi>Grace in the Heart,</hi> and <hi>God in the Eye; when Saints have dealt faithfully and cloſely with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, afford them no ſmall relief under their Preſſures and Diſcouragements from what they feel.</hi> Here then Obſerve, 1. What <hi>David</hi> adviſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto: <hi>Hope thou in God.</hi> 2. How he Argues and Enforces this his Counſel upon himſelf: <hi>For I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Counſel which he offers to himſelf, is this, <hi>viz. To Hope in God.</hi> He would not look upon his Caſe as deſperate: But, 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Caſe and Soul to God, and leave them wholy with him. 2. And ſo expect Protection and Redreſs, from God, in doing thus. And what is <hi>Hope,</hi> but <hi>a deſirous expectation of theſe Mercies and Reliefs from God, which preſent Exigencies and Concerns may need and call for, whereas Gods Name and Promiſes are our Encouragements thereto?</hi> This <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to, and urges upon himſelf in his dejected frame of Spirit, as his beſt Succour and Support; and as his choiceſt Refuge and Remedy: and he was very apprehenſive of this, <hi>That his Soul muſt be active herein, if he would be benifited hereby.</hi> And hence, he ſuffered not his Spirit to be Idle, nor to be guilty of any culpable application and improvement of that great (but oft times much abuſed) Truth: <hi>[We can do nothing of our ſelves, 'tis God alone muſt help us.]</hi> But he turns Counſellor and Commander, and becomes a ſtrict Inquiſitor, and moſt impartial Judg, to his own Soul: and by the meek exerciſe of all juſt Providence and Authority towards his own Spirit, he works himſelf up to his <hi>Hope in God,</hi> by an Eye fixed there; and thence, and thus, expects his help. And though he was deeply ſenſible of his own doleful State at preſent, and very prone to aggrevate his own Calamity, and apt to give up all for loſt; yet he reſolves upon all fit Enquiries after help; and with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and great force of Argument, he here Commands, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon himſelf to hope in God. <hi>Such work requires good Conſideration, great Reſolution, and the juſt exerciſe of all Authority over our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His Arguments and Motives hereunto are impregnated with very great Senſe and Strength: and urged upon himſelf as the juſt Rate thereof. <hi>Hope thou in God:</hi> For he is, 1. <hi>God.</hi> 2. <hi>Thy God.</hi> 3. <hi>The Health of thy Countenance.</hi> And, 4. <hi>One whom thou ſhalt</hi> (certainly, and for ever, <hi>Sym.) Praiſe as ſuch.</hi> And, 5. Do it <hi>Yet. viz.</hi> As la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and hopeleſs as thy Caſe appears at preſent, through ſeeming
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:42587:366" rendition="simple:additions"/> difficulties or unlikely-hoods. <hi>God, and our Selves, well underſtood, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, and skilfully urged and improved, give Gracious Hearts the beſt Encouragements and Supports under the ſevereſt Accidents of Time.</hi> And they will very ſtrangely animate our Hopes in God, under our ſoareſt Troubles and Dejections. <hi>David,</hi> 1. Had Confidence in God. And, 2. Reaſons for it. 3. And Skill and an Heart to urge them. When he reviewed himſelf, he ſaw, that his Soul was gracious, and ſo he knew God valued it: It was bent for praiſing God; and ſo he knew, that he ſhould have an opportunity, and cauſe to do it, through ſome ſignal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors from him: He had an Intereſt in God; and he would neither loſe it, nor neglect it: and he had great experience of Gods former Mercies; and he would not forget them. And when he thinks on God, then Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be thought on too, and every thing relating to it; and all the Divine Perfections, within the Circumference of his Knowledg, muſt have their freſh Remembrances, and powerful Senſe Revived upon his own Heart: For he concludes, that, 1. God is Eminent, and Infinite in all Perfection. 2. That his Eminence ſhall be evident, and conſpicuous in the Salvation and Relief of <hi>now</hi> Dejected <hi>David.</hi> 3. And that moſt ſuitably to all the Circumſtances and Preſſures of his Afflicted State. And that, 4. Rather much beyond, than any way beneath, his preſent Hope. And hence he calls God, the Health of his Countenance. His Thoughts and Hopes are in their higheſt Flights and Vigor. He looks upon God, as his Saviour, Hope and God, and judges God reſolved and propence to appear and act accordingly on his behalf. He looks for ſuch illuſtrious Signals of Gods Favor and Reſpects, as ſhall, 1. Embolden him, undauntedly to face his Enemies without any marks of a dejected and diſturbed Soul upon his Face. 2. Such as ſhall ſhame his Enemies, and humble their contemptuous and proud Looks; and ſhame thoſe Inſolencies whereby they had upbraided him with his God; and make them readily acknowledg, that there is no Rock like <hi>Davids</hi> God, and that his Hope and Refuge were not vainly fixed there. 3. Such, as ſhould redeem his Holy Hopes and Courſes from Contempt and Scorn, and make his embittered Enemies to wiſh themſelves even in Deſpiſed <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe; for <hi>David</hi> here expects Salvation, as ſomething viſible, ſpeedy and compleat, even in the Land of the Living. Well therefore might he ſay, <hi>Hope thou in God,</hi> thereby to redreſs and check his own deſpondent Spirit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And here, the State and Temper of <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit is remarkable, for it was, 1. Senſible of Gods hand, and Mans upon it. 2. Obſervant of its own reſentments and deportment under its Grievances. 3. Therefore much converſant with it ſelf. 4. Deſirous of ſome Redreſs, but yet from God alone, and not only deſirous, But alſo, 5. Duly provident and induſtrious to obtain it; looking within to ſee its Maladies; and above, to get Relief and Succour, for having Grace to act it, and God to help it, and a Covenant of Promiſes to encourage and ſupport it, it was reſolved, and at work, to Act moſt like its conſiderate and gracious Self; and to make its beſt of God.</p>
            <pb n="930" facs="tcp:42587:367" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Secondly, Let us now conſider theſe words, as they contain what is Doctrinal to us: as giving us ſome Notices of our preſent State and Duty: of what we are liable unto; <hi>viz.</hi> To be <hi>caſt down and diſquieted:</hi> and of what we are to do, when exerciſed thus; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe our ſelves. And, 2. To urge our Hope in God upon our ſelves, and to preſs upon our ſelves, what may enforce it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We find that all paſſages of Sacred Writ, are upon Record for our Inſtruction and Advantage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. And why not this amongſt the reſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are exhorted to take the Prophets, who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering Affliction, and of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>James</hi> 5.10. And ſuch was <hi>David, Acts</hi> 2.30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in this Great and Exemplary Prophet, we have this Four-fold Mirrour. 1. A Mirrour of the Calamities, whereto the beſt of Men may be expoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To be <hi>caſt down</hi> and <hi>diſquieted:</hi> Dreadful Afflictions, and Diſmal Apprehenſions and Conſtructions ariſing from them, and deep Reſentments of them, are incident to the holyeſt and beſt Men. <hi>I am troubled: I am bowed down greatly: I have Roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of my Heart: Thy Arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy Hand preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me ſore,</hi> Pſal. 38.2, 6, 8. I need not tell you what preſſures were upon the Spirit of the Lord Chriſt, and how they were reſented by him. 2. A Mirrour of that peculiar work at home, which gracious Souls in their Afflictions are to mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6, 11. &amp; 4.4. They muſt ſearch into, and commune with themſelves about what lies upon them, and how it is born and taken by them. 3. A Mirrour of that redreſs and remedy whereunto they muſt repair, when thus exerciſed and afflicted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. &amp; 56.3. <hi>Let me not be aſhamed, for I put my truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 25.20. None but God, and nothing but hope in him can give relief unto the troubled Soul. And then, 4. A Mirrour of that Grace and Wiſdom which prompts and fits Men to Diſcourſe themſelves, and to hope in God. Hope <hi>thou,</hi> for <hi>I ſhall yet— let integrity and uprightneſs preſerve me, for I wait on thee,</hi> Pſal. 25.21. Here you may ſee the Holy poyſe and bent of gracious Souls. Sufferings, though never ſo manifold and mighty, and continuing, will never bring the graceleſs Soul home, to it ſelf or God. Only great thoughts of God, and a due ſpace of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and promiſes to us, and of his intereſt in us, can make us bear up our deſpondent and afflicted Spirits, by fixed hope in God; and bring us to diſcourſe our ſelves to purpoſe. The Power and Tendency of Holy Principles, and of gracious diſpoſitions, are here conſpicuous and legible in my Text; take then the Senſe thereof in this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive propoſition following.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>When gracious Souls are caſt down, and diſquieted within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhould diſcourſe themſelves, and revive thoſe thoughts, and ſuch a Senſe of God upon themſelves, as may encourage and enforce their hopes and confidence in God,</hi> Pſal. 77.6, 10. Holy <hi>David,</hi> he is here a pattern to us
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:42587:367"/> all. For here you ſee, that in the greateſt Agonies and Conflicts of his Spirit, with what attempted thus to bear and keep it down, <hi>David</hi> here. 1. Makes a right and amiable repreſentation of God to himſelf, he <hi>ſets him always before him,</hi> (as the Lord Jeſus did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25.) and that 1. As God. 2. As his God. 3. As the health of his Countenance. 4. As One that he ſhould praiſe, and therefore he expected the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of this God for him. 5. As One who in his great and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appearances for his Releif, would maſter all thoſe difficulties which any ways might threaten to obſtruct the paſſages of his deſired and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Succours to him. For I ſhall yet, (<hi>i. e.</hi> let things be as they will at preſent) praiſe him. 2ly, He thence expects great things. Such as are matters of high praiſes and acknowledgments to his God.

Confitebor ei (vul. lat.)</hi> and infers them from theſe cheering conſiderations of his God. 3ly, He improves what he diſcovers and infers, for the fixing of his hope in God. 4ly, And all this is to rebuke and moderate his (otherwiſe too extravagant) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and diſturbances, ariſing from exceſſive Sorrows, Fears and Cares. So that you ſee, that <hi>no ſorrows or dejections muſt baniſh or divorce us from our ſelves and God; and from juſt hopes in him.</hi> No Calamities ſhould lay gracious Perſons Proſtrate at their Feet. But they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and argue with themſelves: and bring their Sorrows to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Teſt and Scrutinies, leſt they promote their own diſtreſſes by ſinful negligences and inadvertencies: and make themſelves to be the leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of thoſe Encouragements and Supports, which they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe derive with eaſe from him, who is their God, and under ſtrong propenſions and engagements to act and to approve himſelf accordingly for their good. Good Men are too propenſe, and apt to make their Cups more bitter than ever God intended they ſhould be; whilſt they attend more unto the reſentments of their afflicted, than to the hopes, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Principles of their gracious ſelves. We wreſt Gods dealings with us, and then we cenſure him, for what we bring upon our ſelves. But Grace directs to better things, and prompts Men firſt to ſelf-diſcourſes and debates about what is ſo very hard upon them, that ſo the malady with its impreſſions and effects upon them, being well underſtood, the remedy may the better be conſidered and improved by them; for as we can do nothing without God: ſo he miſtakes the proper ſtate &amp; methods of Divine Redreſſes and Releifs, that looks for any thing from God, whilſt he neglects himſelf But let me ſhew you the reach and purport of this Doctrine, in theſe few following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> I. No Man ſo Great or Good in this World, but he may fall under preſſing and uncomfortable Circumſtances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.12. &amp; 7.8. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. <hi>the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poyſon thereof drinketh up my Spirits, the terrours of God ſet themſelves in battle array againſt me,</hi> Job. 6.4. We have here neither a continuing City nor reſting Place, the troubles of the Patriarchs, Saints, and Martyrs, yea, and of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, are a full proof of this Truth.</p>
            <pb n="932" facs="tcp:42587:368" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> II. Though Men be Great and Good, yet may their Souls be caſt down and diſquieted within them. <hi>My Soul refuſed to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, my Spirit was overwhelmed in me,</hi> Pſal. 77.2, 3. 'Tis hard and rare for the beſt Men, to keep their Spirits compoſed and equal, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles urge them cloſely. The time would fail me, and the limits of this diſcourſe would be tranſgreſt, ſhould I but ſhew you from ſacred writ, what paſſionate eſcapes might be obſerved from Gods Worthies there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> III. Good Men ſhould therefore well diſcern, and weigh what troubles and anxieties are upon them, and not increaſe their loads and ſorrows, by being ſtrangers to themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.28. and they ſhould well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh too betwixt what God inflicts upon them, and what they cauſe unto, and lay upon themſelves; and ſift their troubles to the bottom, they muſt obſerve what it is that troubles them, and ſo ſurvey their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and not ſubject themſelves to ſtrange Confuſions and Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.20. for tis not what we think of what afflicts us, but what God really inflicts upon us, that we muſt mind.

            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> IV. What troubles and reſentments by gracious Perſons are obſerved, ſhould be diſcourſed by them, with their own Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. they are to ask themſelves how theſe evils came upon them. Is it the immediate hand of God that layes them on? if ſo, what have I done againſt the Lord my God? Have I neglected or negligently managed any parts of publick or private Worſhip: as Prayer, Praiſe, Thanks, Hearing, Sacraments, or Sanctification of the Lords Day? Have I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God, by miſrepreſenting him to others, or to my ſelf? Have I reflected any diſhonour upon my Chriſtian Calling? Have I neglected the exciting and improving of the Grace of God in me, in any of its Principles or Functions? Or have I behaved my ſelf unworthily or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently towards others or my ſelf? Or is it by the Tongues or Hands of Men that God afflicts me? If ſo, what inſtances of injuriouſneſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, indiſcretion, or immoderate paſſion can I or others charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf? What undue heats or ferments, have they diſcerned in my Spirit, by raſh or wrathful words or actions? If any failures have been on my part; where, when, and how, and why were they committed by me? If none of theſe are, have been, or can be charged upon me; what do I undergo from God or Man, that Gods great Favourites have not undergone before me? And why may not I repair unto the ſame En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and Conſolations, which have Relieved and Supported them, when they have been exerciſed as I am? What! can not I pledge the beſt Men, in the moſt bitter Cups, but I muſt preſently entertain
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:42587:368" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſmal and undue thoughts of God, and make cenſoriouſly the worſt Conſtructions of what he lays upon me? For to think, or ſay, that God deals unfaithfully or unkindly with me, is to conclude and utter; what, neither the Name nor Love of God, nor the experiences of his beſt and wiſeſt Servants will allow of; therefore our calm and cloſe debatings of theſe matters with our ſelves, put us into a fair way to obtain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures and Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> V. Good Men when moſt diſquieted and dejected, are then to diſcourſe their <hi>gracious</hi> Selves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. and to conſider what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, as well as what is laid upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whoſe, who, and what they are by Grace; and ſo, repreſs the tumults and deſpondencies of their own Spirits, for they that are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied can never be forſaken of their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> VI. A revived Sence of God, of their Intereſt in him, and of their expectations from him, afford great Succours and Supports to gracious Souls, and ought to be pleaded and urged upon them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when all things look dreadfully towards them, both within and about them, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. impatience and deſpondency are beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked. Hereby, a Sence of God muſt be revived; for as we think of God, ſo ſhall we value our relation to him; and fix and keep our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, and proportionate our expectations from him, and 'tis to this end that we have ſuch glorious and great accounts of God in ſacred writ, as to his attributes of Power, Wiſdom, Patience, Grace, <hi>&amp;c. Riches and Honour are with him, all Kingdom, Glory, and Power are</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto him: and tis with him, how things ſhall go with us, and in all the parts of his Creation. It is Peace or War with us; ſerenity or diſturbance in us; and Good or Evil towards us, as God himſelf deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth concerning us, <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. and he that <hi>worketh all things after the Counſels of his own Will,</hi> is to be concluded and believed to be as <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Gracious,</hi> as he is either <hi>Wiſe</hi> or <hi>Great;</hi> for as Power is his Majeſty, and Holineſs is his Glory; ſo Mercy is his Riches; and to him it is a pleaſure to be kind and bountiful; and a Name of Praiſe and Joy to be abundant in Compaſſions and Remiſſions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. &amp; 33.8, 9. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. And yet this is not all, but our relation to, and intereſt in him, muſt be revived in the remembrances thereof upon our own Hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.18. Every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is for relative purpoſes and deſigns, and ſo affords us great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 6. <hi>My God! the God of my Life? I will ſay to God my Rock, why haſt thou forgotten me?</hi> Pſal. 42.8, 9. <hi>O my Strength, to thee will I ſing, for God is my Defence, and the God of my Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 59.17. &amp; 68.20. <hi>thus</hi> David <hi>encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. and here the Foundation of our livelieſt hopes is fixt; for as Gods infinite perfection aſſures us that he can do all things, ſo his relation to us, and our intereſt in him, aſſures us that he will be gratious to us, and hereto may we ſafely truſt; and in the Sence hereof may we addreſs to God by Prayer and Hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.2, 12. &amp; 109.26. &amp; 119.114. And
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:42587:369" rendition="simple:additions"/> then the ſence and value of what we are to look for, is to be lively too upon our heart. Slighty and Contemptible Thoughts and Eſtimations of what we look for, will never conſiderably ſtem the Tide, nor ſtop the Fluxes of our Sorrows and Diſcouragements. Gods Favour is a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bleſſing, and as the Root of all the reſt; his Face is glorious and delightful, when indeed it ſhines upon the Soul; the Rays and Beams which this Gods Bleſſed Face diffuſes and tranſmits, are ſupplies of Grace for all the Duties of a dark and ſtormy Seaſon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 9. Supports of Spirit under troubles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11, 12. delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from them, when moſt of God may be diſcovered, and moſt Good brought to paſs thereby, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34, 19. and great Advantages to Souls by ſuch Exerciſes, whilſt they abide upon them, <hi>James</hi> 1.2, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. and ſo a conſequent Emboldning of the Heart and Face towards God, others, and themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.16, 17. &amp; 119.41, 42. &amp; 109.25, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> VII. Good Men can never ſettle and compoſe their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed Spirits, till they proceed to actual ſolid Hope in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.5, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 21. Here is the Souls only Anchor and Repoſe from the <hi>great</hi> God alone, there it muſt expect <hi>great</hi> things; for nothing can be <hi>too great</hi> for him to give or do, if once he be reſolved upon it; from <hi>their</hi> God they may look for <hi>ſpecial</hi> and peculiar Favours and Reliefs, in juſt and full agreements with all his Covenant-Relations to them, and Engagements for them, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. And what have good Men to keep their Spirits up, but hope in ſuch a God? 'tis only his Omnipotence can weigh againſt the difficulties; his Faithfulneſs, againſt the Improbabilities; and his Grace and Promiſes, againſt the Jealouſies and Diſheartnings that ariſe from the delays of their defined and expected Mercies; all other expectations and encouragements are but vain; theſe hopes in God have their ſure Footing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. &amp; 119.38, 41. &amp; 23.4. <hi>Their hope,</hi> as he is <hi>God,</hi> is All-ſufficient; as he is their God, he tenderly and compaſſionately careth for them: and he thinks himſelf concerned, both to fulfil, and juſtifie their Hopes. And as he is thus theirs by Covenant, he will both ſeaſonably and effectually make their chearful Looks to teſtifie the abſolute Satisfactions of their Hearts in their Experienced Accompliſhments of all his gracious Promiſes to them. And as he is <hi>the health of their Countenance,</hi> ſo they account the Sanctuary and Spiritual Unveylings and Returns of his Face, to be the Glory and Salvation which they are moſt concerned, and carried out to look for, and to Glory in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.2, 4, 5. Here therefore they may ſafely truſt, and reſt themſelves, who otherwiſe, cannot but be as reſtleſs as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, whilſt from the Ark; and as diſcontented and diſtracted as wandring <hi>Cain,</hi> under the Execution of Gods diſmal <hi>Doom</hi> and Curſe upon him. He only that is confident, that God is truſty, and that ſo commits himſelf, and all, to God <hi>as ſuch;</hi> and this under great expectations, that God will keep and anſwer all his hopes and
<pb n="935" facs="tcp:42587:369" rendition="simple:additions"/> truſt: and that here ſtays and reſts his Thoughts and Soul in this, that God is certainly his Friend and God, and will accordingly befriend him, in the beſt Seaſon, and to the higheſt purpoſe and advantage. He I ſay, only can thus ſtill the Tumults of his own Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> VIII. Good Mens Hope in God ſhould never be diſcouraged by any difficulties or unlikelihoods in the way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 22. Seeing the Patron of their Expectations is ſo <hi>great</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> ſo <hi>near</hi> as <hi>their God,</hi> and ſo much in their Eye, of 1. Expectation, as the Health of their Countenance: And 2. Of their Reſolution and Deſign, as to make him the Object of their Praiſes, and the Avouched and Adored Author and Giver of their Mercies. And 3. Of their Affection and Delight, as no ways thinking of ſuch joyful work as Praiſe, till he appear; nothing can juſtifie Dejections, where God concerns himſelf to help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22. It is no great matter how things appear within, before us, or about us, whilſt God ſtands well affected towards us, and can be truly called our Praiſe and God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35, 37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13. &amp; 51.12, 13. Nothing can change or hinder him; and why ſhould any thing diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage His, whom Grace hath brought to truſt in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſi.</hi> IX. What ever Gracious Souls expects from God, they ſtill determine and refer all to his Praiſe and Service, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 75. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.7, 17. &amp; 116.7, 9. they neither deſire, expect, nor uſe, any Salvation or Supports, ultimately for themſelves, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.12, 13. Gods Excellence is obſerved in all, and his Glory is deſigned and purſued by all; and indeed God is the End and Sweetneſs of all Mercies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. And this was reſolved upon, by Holy <hi>David,</hi> as both his Sanctuary-Honour, his Houſe-Enrichment, and his Hearts delight. The Health of his Countenance muſt be the Inhabitant of his Praiſes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us now conſider this Text as a Directory to guide us to, and in, the Reſolution of this Caſe before us. The Caſe is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How may a Gracious Perſon, from whom God hides his Face, truſt in the Lord as his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you compare the Caſe and Text together, you will find them Paralel in theſe particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Perſons. <hi>David, that Holy Perſon,</hi> was concerned in the Text; and a <hi>Gracious Perſon</hi> is here concerned in the Caſe. That <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a Gracious Perſon, none can doubt, that read and mind his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Breathings in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> nay, they muſt conclude him to be <hi>greatly</hi> ſuch; for what Raptures, Fervours and Appeals, what Holy Agonies and Flights of Spirit: What Glorious Accounts of God and Providence: And what Inſtances of Holy Confidence in God may you diſcern?</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their Caſes. The One is <hi>caſt down and diſquieted;</hi> and <hi>Gods Face is hidden</hi> from the other. Now Gods <hi>hiding of his Face</hi> inſinuates moſtly,
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:42587:370" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome diſtaſt taken; and thus it hints the Cauſe, to be ſomething neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or committed, or not well managed and performed, which therefore God cannot approve of in any of his Favourites; for God diſlikes all Nonconformity to his Will, either in the matter, manner, principle, means or end, of any Inſtance of Deportment, towards God, our ſelves, or others; though ſometimes this hideing of Gods Face may be for other purpoſes, not now to be Inſiſted on. The Soul is <hi>caſt down, and diſquieted,</hi> ſaith the Text: And thus we have the terrible Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Effects of this Ecclipſed Face of God upon the Spirit of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon; the Caſe is doleful, though Gods Deſign therein be Wiſe and Merciful; for the ſenſible Tokens of Gods Gracious Face or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, may be, and are, often times removed, or with-held to try the Soul; to awaken dormant Principles and Graces to their moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantageous Exerciſes: To prevent ſome greater Miſchiefs which would ariſe from Divine Conſolations unſeaſonably or unfitly placed: To make and to expoſe to publick View ſome Monuments of Signal Deliverances, Salvations and Supports; and to form ſome Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mirrours and Examples of Signal Patience and Submiſſions to the Will of God: And all this may be done to ſerve more Glorious Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, than any Man in Fleſh can be aware of, and to do the Church and World, and the Concerns of Gods own Name, more Service, than we can yet diſcern.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In their Courſe for Remedy and Redreſs. <hi>David</hi> here (after his Self-Enquiry and Arraignment) applies himſelf to <hi>hope in God,</hi> to which, he argues and confines himſelf by the revival of a due ſence of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Spirit, and a clear repreſentation of God to himſelf, as his <hi>Salvation,</hi> Praiſe, and God; this for the Text. Let us now compare the Caſe therewith; and here the Gracious Soul is ſuppoſed to be upon the Enquiry, and Search, what to do, (when God hath hid his Face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from) that he may <hi>truſt in the Lord as his God.</hi> Now <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> are oft Synonimous, and taken in Holy Scripture as expreſſive of the ſame thing; and ſure I am, that though they may be diſtinguiſhed, yet they cannot be divided each from other. No Man can Truſt, but he muſt Hope; nor Hope, but he muſt Truſt, in God. Lay then the Caſe and Text together; and theſe things will be Evident, 1. That the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon is concerned in both. 2. That God ſome way or other hides his Face from both. 3. That God is yet the God of both, and therefore to be eyed and owned, as ſuch, by both. 4. That Hope or Truſt in God gives the beſt relief to both, when thus Afflicted, if fixed in God <hi>as their God.</hi> 5. That this may be done, and muſt. 6. The great Enquiry and Concern of both, is, How they may be done? Let me here Premiſe theſe things,</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Gracious Perſon is one that is changed and actuated by the Grace of God; and ſo, prevailingly bent and ſet for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3. One formed and framed after that gracious Pattern from the Goſpel-Mount, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24 A Man of Holy Gracious
<pb n="937" facs="tcp:42587:370" rendition="simple:additions"/> Principles, Diſpoſitions, Converſation, and Deſigns. A Man radically after Gods own Heart, and formed to fulfil all Gods Wills, relating to him in his Sphere and Province. He is (as <hi>David</hi> in the Text) One that, 1. Well Obſerves, and much Converſes with his own Soul. In all Varieties and Stages of Conditions here, he makes his own Soul his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care and ſtudy, and ſtrictly minds how all things go at home; you ſee here <hi>David</hi> is a ſtrict Enquirer into the Temper, Caſe and Cure of his own Soul. He is One that, 2. Still looks higher then himſelf, in all that happens to, or lies upon him. He knows his hopes and buſineſs are not confined within himſelf: For he takes himſelf to be concerned with God, as well as with his own Soul. 3. He is One that is reſtleſs, and ſenſibly uneaſie to himſelf, till he look up in God; and till his Spirit turn towards him, he runs not to Debauching Recreations and Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to turn away his Troubles, nor to the Blandiſhments and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſupports of the World or Fleſh. For theſe he knows, will rather cheat and ſtupifie, than refreſh, compoſe or heal, his wounded Spirit. But he repairs to God, as to the moſt delightful and ſure Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and ſatisfaction of his Inner-Man. 4. He is One who therefore hath the higheſt thoughts of God, and thinks it beſt and ſafeſt for him, to place his Confidence in God as in the Rock of Ages. His Caſe, he thinks, cannot be deſperate, though never ſo intricate and frightful, whilſt God may be engaged by him to be his Friend and God. 5. He is One that in his Hopes and Exerciſes ſtill keeps his Eye upon the Praiſe and Service of his God, for all the Reliefs and Mercies which he Deſires, Requeſts, and Hopes for, have both their meet and chearful references to Gods Praiſe; and when he hath cauſe and opportunity, he hath an Heart to Praiſe his God; and 'tis his greateſt Aim, and Pleaſure, and Ambition. 6. He is One that deals impartially with himſelf about his Troubles, but dares not challenge God about them; nor Arraign him about even the ſevereſt of his Providential Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God may be called the God of ſuch a Gracious Perſon, as he is, 1. That God to whom he is Devoted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3, 23. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſerve and pleaſe. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this Day to be thy God; to walk in his Ways, to keep his Statutes, Commandments and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to hearken to his Voice,</hi> Deut. 26.17. And as he is, 2. That God in whom he places all his felicity and ſatisfaction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25, 26. and <hi>the health of my Countenance; my Portion,</hi> Lam. 3.24. the <hi>gladneſs of my Joy,</hi> Pſal. 43.4. And as he is, 3. That God who hath by <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Engaged himſelf to be <hi>his God,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.24. For he hath given his heart and hand, ſo to be the God of ſuch a One, as never utterly to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 31, 39. Nor to reject their Souls hereafter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods <hi>hiding of his Face</hi> from a Gracious Perſon muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as to, 1. The Phraſe. 2. The Thing.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="938" facs="tcp:42587:371" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. As to the Phraſe, 1. It is Scriptural, <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8. &amp; 59.2. and it frequently occurs in Sacred Scriptures. 2. It is Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical and alluſive unto Men, who are ſaid to hide, or turn away their Faces, when they will not be ſeen, or ſpoken to, or converſed with, in any amicable, or ſerviceable ways; whether in deſign and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, or through diſtaſt; ſtrictly, God hath no Face; and ſo, cannot be ſaid to hide it; and if you take Gods Face, for his preſence or his appearance, manifeſted by ſeveral Inſtances, and Symbals, and Tokens thereof; then, in ſome reſpects Gods Face is never hid; for both his Works and Providences declare the Univerſality and Nearneſs of it; and in ſome reſpects again, it may be, hath been, and is hidden, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from ſome or other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to <hi>the thing,</hi> therefore, we are to underſtand by the hiding of Gods Face, his removing or with-holding of all, or any of thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Tokens, whereby his merciful and delightful Preſence with us, his gracious acceptance of us to his Favour, and his Providential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to us, are uſually teſtified, even ſenſibly to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.17. <hi>I will hide my Face from them, and they ſhall be devoured; and many Evils and Troubles ſhall befal them, ſo that they will ſay in that Day, are not theſe Evils come upon us, becauſe our God is not amongſt us, And I will ſurely hide my Face in that Day,</hi> Deut. 31.17. And now this is done in ſeveral ways and ſences. As, 1. By Baniſhing gracious Perſons from his Sanctuary-preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. And this was <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe, and a ſore Affliction to his Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may be ſomething of, but not the main thing, as to the Caſe in hand. 2. By the intermiſſion or ſuſpenſion of Gods Providence, Care and Mercies, as to thoſe Inſtances and Effects, which would make our Lives and Courſes here, more ſweet and eaſie to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22, 26. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy ſelf in times of Trouble?</hi> Pſal. 10.1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me? How long ſhall I take counſel in my Soul, having Sorrow in my Heart Daily? How long ſhall mine Enemy be Exalted over me?</hi> Pſal. 13.1, 2. Thus is God ſaid <hi>to hide his Face</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>Jacob, Iſa.</hi> 8.17. And thus when Providence treats and uſes us in this World; and moſt, or all our outwards Comforts and Concerns, are ſo perplext, embittered and removed, as if our God would hereby tell us, That he regards and minds us not, and will not be concerned for our outward peace and welfare. Then is it, that God may be ſaid to <hi>hide his Face;</hi> yet neither is this the thing that is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended in my Caſe. 3. By Gods denying and with-holding, all probabilities and preſages of relief, from either Men or Things, and all ſenſible intimations of his own purpoſe to befriend us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9, 11. <hi>I will ſhew them the Back, and not the Face, in the Day of their Calamity,</hi> Jer. 18.17. And, <hi>I hid my Face from them, and gave them into the hand of their Enemies; ſo fell they all by the Sword,</hi> Ezek. 39.23. Thus, when God withers every helpful Arm, defeats all Enterpriſes towards deliverance and ſupports, and ſhuts up every Door of Hope, and by
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:42587:371" rendition="simple:additions"/> the whole viſible Frame and Poſture of ſecond Cauſes, looks towards us, and upon us as an angry frowning God. Then is he ſaid to <hi>hide his Face;</hi> but this is not what the Caſe principally reſpects. And therefore, 4. God mainly <hi>hides his Face,</hi> when he with-holds thoſe inward ſenſible tokens of Reſpects, which his Spirit uſually affords to Holy Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.14. when he deals with us as if our Souls were utterly, or very much deſpiſed and neglected by him. Thus God tells us, that he will <hi>no more hide his Face from his People, becauſe he had poured out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.29. This is the Face of God indeed, when his Spirit fills our Souls with all its Joys and Graces, and his Face is hid indeed, when we have no ſenſible Refreſhments and Recruits from that Comforter the Holy Ghoſt, by whom all Correſpondencies muſt be maintained betwixt our God and us, and thus our Caſe mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends. We find a Man recorded for his Patience, crying out, <hi>wherefore hideſt thou thy Face, and holdeſt me for thy Enemy?</hi> Job 13.24. and when looks God more like an Enemy, then when he denies all ſenſible illapſes and recruits of inward Light, and Life, and Joys? Is it not dreadful to have our Sanctuary cluſters, to reliſh of no Bleſſing in them? The Dews of Heaven are oft in Holy Services and Doctrines diſtilled upon us, and our Addreſſes thither have been oft repeated and renewed; but where is the Bleſſing and Succeſs we look for? Our Souls we find in our own Apprehenſions, to be contracted, degraded, and benummed, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rage, and make their rude reſiſtances to all our Sentiments and Convictions, Conſcience oft quarrels with us, and when Gods Rods are on us, we ſenſibly diſcern great diſcompoſures in our thoughts: ſtrange Mutinies and Tumults in our Paſſions; uneaſineſs in our Spirits: and damp upon our Hopes, ſadneſs on our Hearts, and a ſtrange readineſs to reſiſt all that God ſpeaks and doth, and how can we imagine that Gods Heart and Face ſtand toward us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Truſting</hi> in the <hi>Lord</hi> as <hi>his God</hi> in ſuch a Caſe as this, takes in abundance, and amounts to much, and theſe things it offers to the firſt obſervant and conſiderate glance. 1. That the Object be truſty, and no otherwiſe can he be, who is <hi>God the Lord.</hi> 2.

And what more hopeful token and preſage of ſpecial Favour and Reſpects from God to us can we imagine, than the participation of a Divine Nature, that never can be pleaſed but when aſpiring towards God, and that is inſatiable till it get up to him? What! a Soul created after God, and formed to his Praiſe, and bearing ſuch impreſſes of the Holy One! And yet determined to Dereliction and Deſtruction! Oh how can theſe things be? Read but thoſe Characters of God upon thy Spirit. Mind the propenſions and aſcents of Heaven-born Principles, ſee but what wonders Grace hath wrought already. Hath God aſſayed to tear thy Soul from Satans Paw? Hath he transformed thy Spirit, and made it ſo much a reſemblance of his own Holineſs and Wiſdom? Hath he advanced thine eſteem of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Heaven? Hath he caſt out thy rubbiſh, and raiſed in thee an Habitation for his own Holy Name? And will he demoliſh and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a Monument and Structure to his own Praiſe? Why did God thus illuminate thine Eyes, inflame thy Heart with Holy Fervours and ſo invigorate thy active Powers, as to enable thee to move towards him, but that thou mighteſt attain to, and poſſeſs his higheſt Favours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments? Hath it been ever thus with thee, that nothing can ſatisfie thine Heart but Holineſs, God, and Heaven? Why then hath God thus caſt his Mantle over thee, but to attract and draw thy Soul to him? And hath God put theſe Principles, Inſtincts, and Propenſions into thee, only to torment thee by the unſatisfied enragements of an Holy Thirſt? Is Grace ſo beautiful in another? And is it the leſs valuable and obſervable, becauſe God hath implanted it in thy own ſelf? Art thou made reſtleſs and diſſatisfied every where, but under the influences and ſenſible ſmiles of Gods moſt gracious Countenance? And doth thy God impoſe upon thee, and only trifle with thee? Grace is a Principle and Deſign; ſo truly Heavenly and Exalting, as that its Tendency proves its Extraction, and manifeſts Gods Purpoſes to do thee good for ever. Let this thy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be obſerved; for who can think it likely that God ſhould draw
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:42587:373" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſuch paralel lines upon thy Soul to his own Holy Will; and make thee ſuch an Epiſtle ſo manifeſtly written by his own Spirit; and yet, not allow thee to peruſe thy ſelf, and to form what is wrought within thee, into ſuch pertinent Encouragements and Supports, as thy reſpective Agonies and Diſtreſſes may require? And how can this be done, if no Survey be made, no Inventory taken and conſidered of thine inward Worth and Riches? And certainly from what God works with in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, may it infer great things determined to it, and reſerved for it; for who can think that God would rear an Habitation for himſelf, and not Inhabit it? Or, raiſe a Temple (ſo magnificent and ſumptuous as the Holy Soul) and not fill it with his Glory? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.

Then hadſt thou been ſo inapprehenſive of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin, the beauty of Holineſs, the pleaſure of a well ordered Mind and Life, and of inviſible realities, as that thou wouldſt have eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and born the Image of the Devil and the World upon thee. The thoughts and proſpect of an eternal State would never have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled thee ſo the Severities and Courſes of true Godlineſs: nor have made thee ſo ambitiouſlly ſolicitous for Divine acceptance, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions and fruitions of that State where God is all in all, as now they have done. Surely the Soul that is viſited with the Day-Spring from on High, guiding its Feet into the way of Peace; and all this by the tender Mercy of its God, and ought not ſo eaſily to give up all for loſt, as to deſpair of Light and Help, becauſe of preſent Darkneſs, and of the Valley of the ſhadow of Death. This white Stone, with ſuch a New Name in it, is no ſmall earneſt, nor an obſcure ſign, of everlaſting Mercies and Endearments. God that hath Sanctified the Soul, hath thereby ſignified his gracious Purpoſe to do it Good at laſt; and never ſo to forſake it as to return no more. So then what Holy Principles, Favours, Aims and Actions, God hath brought thee to, and thence encourage and fix thy truſt in God.</p>

               </gap>t yet 'tis to be acknowledged, That God ſometimes doth hide his Face indeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. And that either, 1.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are not here concerned, but the latter; and as to Converted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch as are truly Gracious; God is ſaid to hide his Face from them, when he removes his Candleſtick from them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. or, when they rather only ſee, than really feel, and are bettered by the Light: and are ſcarce ſenſible of either Savour or Power in Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or of any Improvement in, or of themſelves thereby: or when they have not any free Intercourſes with God in Holy Duties, but ever find themſelves to be deadned and ſtraitned in the Addreſſes of their Spirits to God in his Holy Ordinances, of which their Jealouſies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by their being Conſcious to themſelves of much Barrenneſs, Wantoneſs and Ingratitude, under their Sanctuary-priviledges: Or when they are terrified with Storms and Tempeſts in their own Breaſts, through preſſing Fears and multiplied Diſtractions. But here let them conſult Gods Word and Providences, and their own Conſciences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and thus debate this Matter with themſelves: What makes thee think O my Soul, that God now hides his Face from thee? Is it, what is, and hath been, common, either to Mankind, or to the Generation of the Juſt; or ſomething peculiar to my ſelf, and unuſual to others? Is it any thing that can make it Evident, that I either yet was never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gracious, or that Gods Grace is now Extinct in me? Have I an Heart for God; and hath he none for me? Is any thing inflicted on me, inconſiſtent with Gods Saving Love to me? Have my Afflictions Deadned me to God and Holineſs, or cut off the Entail of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Favours
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:42587:374" rendition="simple:additions"/> upon me? Are there noe Caſes and Inſtances of Gods Eclipſed Face, paralel to, or much beyond, my own, to be diſcerned in <hi>Abraham, David, Job, Lot, Chriſt,</hi> or others? See <hi>James</hi> 5.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, 9. <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends got nothing but Reproofs from God, for their inferring Gods Contempt of him, from what God laid on him.</p>
            <p>It is much to be Obſerved, That Gods deareſt Favourites have had the ſharpeſt Exerciſes, and great Darkneſs and Diſconſolateneſs on their Spirits, at ſometimes or other; for the ſenſible Comforts and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, are ſeldom found the Daily Fare of the exacteſt walkers with God under Heaven; and yet how often are theſe Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes greatned by their Fancies or Follies? And then by their Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of God to themſelves, how oft, and much, is he Diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them? But let theſe things be well conſidered by Gracious Souls; 1. God doth not always, nor ever, totally hide his Face from them whom he hath Changed and Transformed through Grace. 2. That when at any time 'tis hid from them, 'tis not hidden in ſo much Wrath, but that Mercy ſhall prevail at laſt. 3. Nor can it ever be ſo dark with them, but that ſome Remedies and Refreſhments may be had, from the Name, the Son, and the Covenant; and from that, of God within themſelves, which they ought not to undervalue, overlook, or to deny; or to quit the Acknowledgments and Comforts of. Nay, I may boldly ſay it, that at the worſt, more of Gods Face doth or may appear to them, and ſhine upon them, than is at any time hidden from them. I mean more of that Face which is diſcernable here on Earth; for otherwiſe, it is but very little of Gods Face, that the beſt Men ſee at moſt in this World, if compared with what is to be manifeſted in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unto the Heirs of Glory. And therefore, is it yet a ſhameful thing, both to be pitied and blamed in gracious Perſons, that every intermiſſion or retreat of ſenſible Joys and Favours, ſhall ſo enrage their Fears and Sorrows, as that Gods tenderneſs and faithfulneſs ſhall preſently be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned: and his moſt gentle Diſcipline, heavily Cenſured, ſtrangely Agravated, extravagantly Reſented, and moſt immoderatly Bemoaned by them? Yea, and that before they have well underſtood what ails them, and unto what degrees their ſo bemoaned Eclipſe hath reached? Come then my Soul, deal fairly with thy Self and God, and tell me, what is it that God hath now denied thee? How far hath God denied it? What of God is it, that thou once haſt ſeen, but canſt not now? What hinders the preſent ſight, or the recovery of what before hath been thy Strength and Joy? Do not miſtake Gods Looks and Heart; nor in a pet, charge God with what he is not guilty of: nor ſay too haſtily; why better with me formerly than now?</p>

It is here as it is in Nature; God feeds us, he cloaths and keeps us: and we truſt in him to do ſo for us; but if we be not provident and diligent in the well ordering and improvement of the helps and benefits, and inſtructions which God affords us in and by ſecond Cauſes: and ſo, expect that Manna come not only down from Heaven, but that it alſo fall into our Mouths; we may eaſily turn this truſt into preſumption, and ſtarve our ſelves, in the midſt of Manna round about us. So, he that expects God ſhould miraculouſly inſpire truſt into him, without the intervenient uſe of his own faculties in the improvement of thoſe helps which God affords, will find ſuch hopes and truſt fitter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked and fruſtrated, than to be gratified and fulfilled. He that would truſt in the Lord <hi>as his God,</hi> is to conſider. 1. Whom he is to truſt in, <hi>the Lord.</hi> 2. For what he is to truſt in him, that he may either ſee his Face again, or be ſupported and preſerved under the Eclipſes of it. 3. Why he is to truſt in him, becauſe of his own neceſſities, and Gods Power and Fidelity to help him: and the encouragements God gives him. 1. Think then O gracious Soul, what a God thou haſt to truſt in. God All-ſufficient, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. &amp; 17.1. Now Gods All-ſufficiency lies (as far as we can know it yet) in the vaſt reaches of his infinite Wiſdom, In the unboundedneſs of his Power, for it is Omnipotent, and in the Riches of his Goodneſs, which knows no bounds in the expreſſions and efforts thereof, but the inviolable harmony of his own Bleſſed Name and Nature, <hi>who worketh all things after the Counſels of his own Will, and the Capacities of his Favourites,</hi> Eph. 1.11. God hath an heart to do thee good, for he is <hi>Love,</hi> and Goodneſs is his Nature and Delight, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. &amp; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. Now Love is Communicative and diffuſive of it ſelf in all ſuch inſtances and expreſſions, as the Caſe and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the beloved object may require, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. Hence you may ſee Gods Paraphraſe upon this attribute; and his moſt Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous explication of it, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. Love pities Favourites in their miſeries and ſelf-bemoanings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 20. Love helps them in their
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:42587:376" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtraits, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8, 9. Love ſupplies them in their wants, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. Love hears their cries, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. Love emboldens, delivers, and preſerves them, and commands all within its Reach and Empire to befriend and ſerve them, to all theſe purpoſes, and in all theſe ways that are moſt ſuitable to it ſelf and them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 3. Canſt thou not therefore truſt in him, who without any violence or repugnancy to himſelf, is ſo propenſe to do thee good? Let then the Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy God come into thy freſh remembrances, and moſt lively thoughts, that ſo thy truſt in him may be encouraged and ſpirited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. How greatly are we reconciled and quickned to place our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where Love is moſt predominate and natural? For thy great mercies ſake, thou didſt not utterly conſume them, nor forſake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. <hi>Now therefore our God, who keepeſt Covenant and Mercy, let not all our trouble</hi> (Hebr. <hi>wearineſs) ſeem little before thee, that hath come upon us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.31, 32.</p>
            <p>And as God hath an heart to do thee good; ſo he hath wiſdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and manage the means and methods of his purpoſed and free Goodneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.8. Now to him that is able to keep you— to the only <hi>wiſe God, Jude</hi> 24.25. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. God guided the wandring <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> under the Wilderneſs, Eclipſes of his Face, by the Skilfulneſs of his Hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72. God beſt knows when to ſhew his Face, to what degrees, and how. He ſees what ails, and what will help thee, he is no ſtranger to thy gloomineſs and droopings; he underſtands wherein, how far, and upon what accounts thou ſo lamenteſt his withdrawments from thee, and what theſe manifeſtations of himſelf are, which will afford the beſt relief to thee. He cannot overlook the proper Article of time, wherein thoſe friendly Aſpects and Appearances which thou coveteſt ſo much, will moſt befriend and ſerve thee, the beſt Men have a Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul Diſtempers in them, and thoſe Divine Diſcoveries which might relieve them in their droopings, may (when deſired by them, were they but then afforded) poſſibly make them proud or careleſs. However, poſſibly God hath not ſufficiently ſerved thoſe purpoſes to which thy doleful preſent exerciſe is directed: and ſo the birth might prove too haſty to be perfect, were it produced when deſired by thee. <hi>Job</hi> little knew (and all his confident preſſing Friends as little) what God was doing by thoſe ſo rigid uſages whereto that Holy patient Perſon was expoſed. God hath more Souls and things to mind than one, and he will make every part and inſtance of his Grace and Goodneſs to harmonize each with other, and is it not more deſirable to every reſigned Soul to God, to abide in this darkneſs for a while, than to have the Courſe and Methods of Gods orderly proceedings diſordered and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, for the meer pleaſing of ſome precipitant deſires? Let God alone, and turn not a cenſurer of his dealings, till thou canſt comprehend his whole Deſign upon his whole Creation, his Family, and on thy Self, and let it ſuffice thee, that infinite Wiſdom is concerned and engaged for thee: and truſt him more, for thou mayeſt ſafely do it, becauſe he is,
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:42587:376" rendition="simple:additions"/> infinitely wiſer than thy ſelf; and knows beſt when to hide, and when to ſhew his Face.</p>
            <p>God hath Ability and Authority, as well as an Heart and Wiſdom to relieve and Favour thee, <hi>Jude</hi> 24. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. <hi>He ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14.4. He is the God of Power, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.2. He can revive or damp thy Spirit at his pleaſure, <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. ſo that there can be no ſuſpicion of impotence or inability with him. He that made Heaven and Earth can ſuccour drooping Hearts, and he that revives this Sence of God upon him, will find his truſt in God more ſweet and eaſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think alſo what thou art now allowed to truſt him with, and for, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. even with thy whole ſelf: and with all that can concern the Church, the World, and thee. Wiſdom for Conduct, Power for due Deliverances, and Protections, and Salvations, and Grace, and Comforts to bear thee up under Burthens and Temptations; and to furniſh thee to every good Word and Work: and to carry thee ſafe to everlaſting reſt: and for the wiſe and happy iſſue of every Duty, Burthen, and Temptation, mayſt thou firmly truſt in God. But be ſure to truſt to him for nothing (as far as thou canſt learn or know it) that is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God to give, and unfit for thee to ask or have. But this you may truſt him for, that he hide nothing of that Face from thee, without which thou canſt not be an holy and an happy Perſon: and that he lay nothing on thee unto the prejudice of thy beſt affairs: and that he never be defective in miniſtring thoſe ſupplies to thee, which his own Glory, the credit of Religion, the publick Good, and the great Duties of thy Place and Station do require: And that he never call the out to any thing beyond thy Strength and Furniture: but that he ſuit thy Strength and Spirit unto the Work and Burthens of thy Place and Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. God will not be offended at thee for ſuch truſt as this; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy devotedneſs, and thy due diligence and prudence in the choice and uſing of all meet Subordinate means and helps, and thy fervent cryes to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Think upon thoſe Encouragements which God hath given to this truſt, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 26.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. thou haſt Gods Promiſes and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75, 76. and theſe are certain, ſuitable, large and precious; and the genuine product of infinite, generous, and reſolved Love. Thou haſt thoſe near and dear Relations which God hath aſſumed and owns to thee, an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Father, King, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 54.5, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.

            <p>Do then as <hi>David</hi> did: Infer from known experience all that may ſtrengthen regular Confidence; for thus did he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.7, 10. and thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 10. The Lord is my Shield and Strength: my Heart truſted in him, and I am Helped, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28 7. And thou haſt the Glory of thy God concerned in the proſperouſneſs of thy Truſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. And now to cloſe up all; Why ſuch manifold Encouragements to Truſt in God, if they were either Vain or Needleſs? And how can any keep up their Truſt in God, without their deep and ſober Thoughts about, and their intent and moſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pauſes on theſe weighty things upon Record, which God hath left, to Juſtifie and Encourage your Truſting in him? It is both Strange and Sad, to ſee many Chriſtians come to their Miniſters with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, or put up Bills for Prayers in Congregations: and to deſire Solemn Days to be ſet apart for them, whilſt they reſt only here: as if they looked to be comforted and ſupported by ſome Charm or Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; they look to be healed by a Word; and they neglect their own Work; they do not ſearch into themſelves, that they may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, the Grace of God hath made them capable of Truſting in the Lord as their God. They bring not their Calamities and Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Teſt, that they may clearly know under what hand of God they are caſt; and how far God hath hid his Face from them; and how far, not. God enters not into their cloſe and ſerious Thoughts, that they may plainly ſee and know what there is in him, to draw their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits forth to Truſt in him: Nor will they ſtudiouſly revive that Sence of God upon themſelves, whereby their Truſt in him may be Engaged, Eſtabliſh'd and Emboldned; and yet they cry, What ſhall we do to Truſt in the Lord as our God? Why Sirs, I will tell you what to do, 1. See that your Intereſt in God be cleared up; this you may know by the prevalency of your Deſires, Purſuits and Satisfactions, and by the Practical Reſignments of your ſelves to him. 2. See what this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God refers, <hi>viz.</hi> Nothing is deſperately loſt at preſent: and all will be well at laſt; and that all lies ſafe that can concern you, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 4. The truth is, all that can be grateful, great and ſure, may be inferred from hence. 3. Accommodate and apply what you infer, as skilfully and faithfully as you can, to your diſtreſſing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Caſe and Circumſtances; there are Hiſtories to tell us what God hath done; and there are Doctrines to tell us, what God is, and can do; and there are Precepts and Inſtructions to direct us, what we are to do: in what Caſes, upon what Grounds and Reaſons, and to what Ends and Purpoſes we may Truſt in God; and God hath given us marks to know what Intereſt we have in him; and a Directory and Helps to get it, if we have it not; and he hath ſhewed us fully and plainly what it is, and what at laſt it will amount to, to want or have this Intereſt in himſelf; and when as we have gotten it, he hath taught us how to apply it fitly, and how to bear our Spirits up in Hope and Truſt thereby: and after all this, and much more, ſhall we be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:42587:377" rendition="simple:additions"/> and lazy, and cry out like Fools and Drones, We know not how to Truſt in God, nor whether he be Ours or not? let us not thus abuſe our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Think on theſe Means and Helps, whereby we may attain to an Ability and Faculty of Truſting in God: and let them be moſt Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved; ſuch as the Word, Sacraments, Sabbaths, Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Meditation, upon the Word and Works of God; but theſe need no Enlargements on them; and my Limits are tranſgreſt already.</p>

               <hi>READER,</hi> Expect not Accuracy here; I am very ſenſible of many Imperfections in this Sermon; I am ſeparated from my helps, having my Bible only, and my God, to help me in my wandring Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Retirements; theſe things are what I have diſcourſed with my own heart; and if ſome Cenſure them, others I hope will Pity and Pray for me; and the God of Heaven accept and proſper theſe (though weak) Endeavours.</p>

It is the great Treaſure that ought to be kept, and uſed well; for out of it are the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. Its Joys and Bitterneſſes lie deep within it ſelf, and they are not be intermedled with by Strangers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. The Countenance of a Man is but the Index of his Spirit: 'tis in the Soul that Joys and Sorrows Center and Seat themſelves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.13. Many Infirmities or Diſtreſſes may eaſily be undergone by a ſound Heart: but if the Spirit it ſelf be wounded, how dreadful are its Wounds! <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. The Spirit of Man is Gods Vicegerent; and a great Mirrour of himſelf; and as it Accuſes and Condemns, when it well underſtands and minds it ſelf, ſo it is the Vail and Repreſentative of its God unto it ſelf, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. &amp; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 21. It can (you

It can look every way, and make both Heaven and Earth, good things and bad, ſome way or other Serviceable to its own Concern: and turn all the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and Notices of its God, to Self-improvements and Relief. It is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Moral Government, and of full Joys and Sorrows, Congenial with its Contracted Principles, Temper and Behaviour, here; It is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Converſe and Communion with its God; of Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Heaven or Hell.

A good Heart within them: A clear Way before them: A good God for them: A good Underſtanding of their Caſe and State: And ſuch Encouraging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments and Supports, ſo ready for them at their Call, when truly needful to them: What greater requiſites than theſe can we mention and propoſe unto our ſelves, to render our Condition eaſie, ſafe and happy, here?

Why may not theſe things bear a Gracious Spirit up, and quicken and embolden it to bid defiance to all Attempts which Earth or Hell can make, to ruin and unhinge it? The Gracious Soul, as ſuch, is fit for any thing; and it is Entitled to the greateſt Bleſſings from its God, and in due Seaſon ſhall poſſeſs them; what God by Grace hath made and brought it to, renders it fit for Gods great Bleſſings and Supports: And what God promiſes, it may ſafely truſt to, and confidently relie upon. The Text here ſhews you what the Gracious Soul can do; it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it ſelf from its immoderate Sorrows, by its faithful deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it ſelf; and by making a right Judgment upon whatever doth at any time befal it; and as there is ſomething in it apt to raiſe Storms, and vexatious Reſentments of its Preſſures and Afflictions: So are there certain Principles, and a Seed of God within them; and <hi>that</hi> in God above them, and before them, which will not always ſuffer their Sorrows and Dejections to tranſgreſs their ſtated Bounds and Rules: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the compoſed and ſtill Soul is fitteſt for Communion with God, Hope in him, Service to him, and Conſolation from him. See here how narrowly <hi>David</hi> obſerved himſelf: How skilfully he diſcourſed himſelf; how powerfully he reſtrained himſelf; and how readily he could and did Enlarge, Encourage, and Exalt himſelf; you may diſcern in him, that Grace will not admit of, nor Countenance any unfit Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; it will not fall heavily with its Cenſorious Carpings upon his
<pb n="954" facs="tcp:42587:379" rendition="simple:additions"/> Providence, nor in an Angry Pet of Frowardneſs and Impatience, fall out with him: It threatens no Revenge to Evil Men; it will not flee to Sinful Shifts and Refuges: neither is any thing Chidden, Cited or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, but the <hi>diſquieted and diſturbed Spirit;</hi> and yet even here, it is not ſo much Clamourous and Impatient, as it is Inquiſitive after, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon its Regular Self-redreſs. If any thing ail it or afflict it, it minds the Grounds, the Meaſures, and the Effects thereof, upon it ſelf. Stupid indeed it is not; for it feels Gods Hand upon it. Immoderate or Careleſs in its Griefs it will not be; for it will call its Sorrows and it Self unto the Teſt and Bar, and there impartially examine all its Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, its Sence of them, and its Behaviour under them: nor will it ſullenly be neglectful of it ſelf in Troubles; for it will urge it ſelf to all Juſt Obſervations and Improvements of its beſt Helps and Remedies: and when it finds that <hi>only hope in God</hi> muſt bear it up, and ſuccour it; Oh then how copiouſly and cloſely is the Name of God conſidered by it? <hi>I ſhall yet Praiſe him: the Health of my Countenance, and my God.</hi> If it be forced abroad (as Holy <hi>David</hi> now was) to Sorrowful Wandrings, Solitudes, and Retirements; its very Privacies ſhall be ſpent in pertinent Soliloquies; and ſo, be improved to its own beſt advantage; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be made to turn to very good account at laſt. It is and will be provident for Soul-good, where e're it is, and what ever it is called to undergo. And when upon impartial ſearch, it finds (as it will quickly do) that no Relief can be expected but from and by Hope in God; how prevalent are its Gracious Principles and Inſtincts, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to look much higher than it ſelf for Help? Nor will it ever look upon its Caſe as deſperate and loſt remedileſly, whilſt there is room and ground for Hope in God to help it; yet is it orderly and calm in its Procedures: for it firſt talks with it ſelf, and then looks up to God; and though it be difficult to diſperſe and quell its Griefs and Sorrows when they are gathered to an head, yet <hi>Duty is Duty, Hot or Cold;</hi> and 'tis not <hi>difficulty</hi> that can divorce the Gracious Soul therefrom. It can find work in Storms and Tryals, for all its Faculties, Principles and Graces, and they muſt vigorouſly perform their Functions, to ſerve thoſe weighty Turns and Purpoſes which ſo much concern the exerciſed Soul: And it well knows, and doth conſider it as wiſely, that Storms and Tumults of this Nature are never truly laid; nor the afflicted Soul refreſh'd either by tranſient and haſty, or by hard Thoughts of God; and it is its happineſs and ſupport, that it hath a God to flee to, an Heart to Hope in him, and to Praiſe him: and an Intereſt in God, and a Covenant of Promiſes from God, to encourage Hope in God.</p>

               <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16. Here is that Anchor which muſt ſtay the Soul, and hold its Hope, when all the Seas of its Concerns and Thoughts are moſt ſevear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt and broken by Storms and Tempeſts in it, and about it. Good Thoughts of God will make us chearfully to endure Afflictions, and to Improve the worſt Condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7, 8. &amp; 43.1, 2. <hi>David here</hi> found Relief when all things elſe proved Miſerable Comforters to him. <hi>The Sorrows of Death compaſſed me about: the Pains of Hell got hold upon me: I found Trouble and Sorrow; then called I upon the Name of the Lord, O Lord deliver my Soul.</hi> And what was his Encouragement? <hi>Gracious is the Lord, and Righteous: alſo our God is Merciful,</hi> Pſal. 116.3, 7.

God here was repreſented by <hi>David</hi> to himſelf, as <hi>His God,</hi> as the <hi>Health of his Countenance,</hi> and as <hi>that God whom he ſhould ſurely Praiſe:</hi> (whatever other Face and Aſpect were at preſent upon things) and by theſe things did he reſolve upon, awaken and refreſh his <hi>Hope in God.</hi> If God be only ſet before our Eyes, as Clothed with Vengeance; as an Inexorable and Severe Judge; and as upon the Throne of Judgment, our Hopes will quickly turn to Deſperation; and who can poſſibly Hope in him, that takes him for his Enemy? But he that remembers and minds God, as <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> as <hi>ready to Commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Caſes of his Afflicted Servants:</hi> and as <hi>One waiting to be Gracious, and ready to Forgive, Hear, Heal and Save:</hi> this Man gets preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wing, and freely throws himſelf, as at the Feet of Mercy, and can more eaſily part with his Life, than with his <hi>Hope in God,</hi> Job 13.15.</p>
            <p>And now (to give no Check to your Patience by my Prolixity) let me cloſe all, and drive the matter home, if poſſibly I may, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to theſe things,</p>

Nothing can ſtint or bound Gods Mercies, nor check the Efforts, and ſenſible Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Productions of Gods moſt Gracious Name, but the culpable unfitneſs of your Souls to be receptive of his Royal Favours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>Rejoyce the Soul of thy Servant: for unto thee (O Lord) do I lift up my Soul; for thou Lord art Good, and ready to Forgive: and plenteous in Mercy to all them that call upon thee.

I cannot now ſtand to open them, leaſt I ſhould grow too large.</p>
            <p>When Sin had torn us from our God, and ſet his Face againſt us; how Diſmally did all things look about, and towards us, then! the Face of God was Terrible: the Thoughts of God were Frightful and Amazing: the Way to God was blockt up from us: and the Majeſty of God was no where viſible, but in the Preſages and Effects of Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jealouſies and Revenges: till Chriſt aroſe, a Prince and Saviour, ſent from God, to give a Glorious Reſurrection to our dead and buried Hopes; there was enough to caſt and keep our Spirits down, and to Diſquiet us for ever; Infinite Wiſdom to contrive our Snares and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Inſuperable Power to bind and keep us to our Torturing Wracks: Inflexibe and Inexorable Juſtice (as to us) incenſt and prompted by deep and keen Reſentments of our Degeneracies and Defections, to call for Rigid Satisfaction; and to Demand the Abſolute Reſignation of our All, unto Divine Revenges: and the Concerns and Glory of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed Government, rendring it needful, that Gods Violated Laws by us, be fully Executed on us, to cut off all Relief and Hope from us: and nothing in our ſelves to be diſcerned, but what muſt Juſtifie Divine
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:42587:380"/> Severities and Revenges on us; and fit us for, and vex us in, that Sea of Wrath and Fury which we expected, and over which we hung: Surely ſuch things as theſe, could not but make us every way Hopeleſs, Helpleſs, and Diſconſolate, and Wrack our Spirits to the utmoſt with Diſquietudes and Dejections. But our Hope dawned when Chriſt was promiſed and prefigured; and made its Advances by gradual diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, towards the Glorious ſhining of that more perfect Day, wherein the Sun of Righteouſneſs aroſe with Healing under his Wings, in <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. And when the Lord Redeemer came, our Hope and Truſt in God was taught by his Doctrine: Enjoined and Regulated by his Laws: Sanctified and illuſtrated by his Practice: Purchaſed by his Blood: Ingenerated and Cheriſhed by his Spirit: Confirmed by his Exhibited and Sealed Covenant, and all his Federal Relations to us: Enforced and Encouraged by his Interceſſion with the Father for us: and its Accompliſhment undertaken and ſecured to the full, by his moſt Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcention, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And its Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is to be viſibly and compleatly full at his Appearance, and his Kingdom; and hence Chriſt is called, <hi>The Bleſſed Hope,</hi> Tit. 2.13. So that with moſt Tryumphant Thankfulneſs and Joy may we Cry out, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us? He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all: How ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things? Who is he that Condemneth, ſeeing it is God that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth; and Chriſt that Died; yea rather, that is Riſen again; who is even at the Right Hand of God; who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us? Who,</hi> or what, <hi>ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt? ſhall Tribulation or Diſtreſs?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 39. And what Acknowledgments to God can bear proportion to ſo great a Gift as this, whereby our Hope and Truſt in God is thus Revived and Exalted? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 27. View but the Face of God in Chriſt, and let that Name of Chriſt be ſtudied by you, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. and then ſee what can any way diſcourage you from Hope, or Truſt in God; the Smiles of Majeſty, and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Grace, which we Expect and Covet, are all from God in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 3.19, 21. Chriſt is himſelf our Hope, and the great Anchor of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18, 20. And it is by him that God ſo Reconciles us to himſelf; as to Encourage and Accept our Hope and Truſt in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 21. Both Comforter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, are through him, <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 22. And he is the Patron and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar of our Hope in God.</p>

If God make great Proviſions to countenance, ſuſtain and raiſe, this Hope and Truſt in him; muſt it not be our care and work to bear our Spirits up in the Livelieſt Exerciſe thereof?

            <p>The Prophet was ſent with heavy Tydings to the People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. OF <hi>Spiritual Judgments</hi> like to befal them, blindneſs of Mind, and hardneſs of Heart to which they ſhould be left, (the moſt dreadful Plague on this ſide Hell) verſe 9.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Temporals</hi> to, verſe 11, 12. <hi>until the Cities be waſted without Inhabitant,</hi> &amp;c. God many times ſeconds Spiritual Judgments with Temporal; they that are under the former, can not be ſecure againſt the latter: they that are inſenſible of the one may be made to feel the other. But leſt it ſhould make the hearts of the few Righteous among them over ſad, and ſhould prove in the event a temptation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and deject inſtead of humbling them, he hath a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meſſage put into his mouth; ſome glad tidings to ballance the evil. Saints ſometimes tremble at thoſe truths in which others are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and wicked Men that ſhould moſt fear them, leaſt regard them. This verſe therefore brings a Cordial for the Saints, as the four former did a bitter Doſe for the ungodly among them. A gracious promiſe we have here of a remnant to be left in the midſt of; and after the diſmal calamities before threatned. <hi>But yet in it ſhall be a tenth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In it,]</hi> In the Land, mentioned verſe 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A tenth,]</hi> A definite number for an indefinite: <hi>a tenth,</hi> i. e. a ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a few in compariſon of the whole Body of the Inhabitants. It was a ſevere puniſhment among the Romans; when, for ſome great miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in their Armies, they would decimate the offending Legions, put
<pb n="960" facs="tcp:42587:382" rendition="simple:additions"/> every tenth Man to Death. But here is a more ſormidable ſeverity, when God would deſtroy nine parts, and ſave onely a tenth, they that were cut off, ſhould be far more than they that were delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſhall return and be eaten,]</hi> Either, as ſome, return from its Captivity, and be Inhabited again, and fed upon again. Or, as others, it ſhall be <hi>eaten,</hi> i. e. <hi>conſumed,</hi> or <hi>removed,</hi> or <hi>burnt,</hi> the Hebrew Word will bear any of theſe Interpretations; <hi>Returning</hi> then muſt ſignifie, by an uſual Hebraiſm, the Iteration of the thing mentioned, the Repetition of the Judgment, and ſo to return and be eaten, is to be eaten again, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed again, which here muſt be underſtood of the remaining <hi>tenth.</hi> If we take it in this ſence, it is not unlike that of <hi>Zack.</hi> 13.8, 9. where two Parts are to be cut off, and die, and the third to be left, and then that third Part is to be brought through the fire. If we thus underſtand the words, the former part of the verſe is rather a threatning than a promiſe, which yet I conceive the whole to be; and ſo it is, if we take this clauſe in the former ſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As a Teil-Tree, and as an Oak whoſe ſubſtance is in them,]</hi> What the Trees here mentioned are, whether the ſame with thoſe that are ſo called with us, or any other peculiar to thoſe Countries, as expoſitors are not agreed, ſo we are not much concerned to enquire.

Some take the word for a proper Name of a Place, 1 <hi>Cron.</hi> 26.16. mention is made of a Gate belonging to the Temple called <hi>Shallecheth,</hi> where they ſay there was a Cawſeway leading up to the Temple, which they ſuppoſe Planted with Trees on both ſides, which not only beautified the Place, but ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it, the Roots of the Trees knitting &amp; keeping up the Earth which had been there caſt up to make the way. This may have a good Sence, if the words in the Original will bear it. I conceive our own Tranſlation, (with which others agree) to be beſt, <hi>when they caſt their Leaves,</hi> and ſo the oppoſition is clear between the <hi>ſtanding of the Stock</hi> and the <hi>falling of the Leaves,</hi> and it notes the Strength, firmneſs, and laſtingneſs of the Tree it ſelf, though it loſe its preſent Beauty, and Verdure. The ſtate lieſt

A Tree in Winter caſts its Leaves, the Sap retiring toward the Root, but yet ſtill the Stock remains firm, and unmoveable, and the Sap that is in it will afterwards cauſe it to ſhoot forth a new: the Tree though bare, is not dead, it hath loſt its Leaves, but not its Life. So when carnal Men, and common profeſſors drop away, like Leaves from a Tree, in the Winter of affliction; or, as withered Bows and Branches, are broken off by the violence of perſecutions, and ſtorms of worldly troubles; then the <hi>Holy Seed,</hi> the truly religious among them, are like the Trunk of the Tree which is not blown down, nor rooted up, but ſtill continues, ſtill lives, and is like to Flouriſh again. What is here ſpoken of the Jews is not peculiar to them, but may likewiſe be affirmed of other profeſſing People, the great ſtaple priviledges of the Church, being the ſame both in Jews then, and Gentiles now: The Seed of God is the Stock, whether Jews or Gentiles be the Branches; there may be a change in the Branches, but not in the Stock; that is ſtill the ſame when wild Branches are grafted in, as it was before the natural were cut off.</p>

            <p n="2">2. I do not reſtrain it to <hi>any particular party, or way, or perſuaſion even among thoſe, who, as to their profeſſion, are really of the true Religion.</hi> Though I am far from ſo looſe and extravagant a Charity, as to judge that Men may be ſaved in any Religion whatever, if they do but live ſuitably to the Principles, and Rules of that Religion, when there are ſo many falſe, ſo many Idolatrous ones, ſo many which deny fundamental truths, or maintain damnable errors: Yet, on the other ſide, I am not
<pb n="962" facs="tcp:42587:383" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo uncharitable as to confine true religiouſneſs, and conſequently final Salvation to any particular ſect or ſort, or party of Men profeſſing Chriſtianity to the excluſion of all that diſſent from them. True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is more affection and Practice, than Doctrine, or Nation, and is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more in the heart than in the head. Men may be really gracious, and ſo in truth religious in Gods account, who yet differ in ſome things from others who are no leſs truly religious too. There is indeed but one true Religion in the World, but in that, we muſt diſtinguiſh between princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and concluſions, and thoſe either nearer, or more remote, between fundamentals, and ſuperſtructures, and thoſe either which touch the foundation, or are farther from it, between ſubſtance, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; things neceſſary or not neceſſary, to the being, or to the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Religion. In ſome things they that are wiſe, and godly, may differ without prejudice to the Salvation of either. Every truth is not neceſſary to Salvation, nor is every error <hi>de facto</hi> Damning. All Mens Light is not alike cleer, nor are all Mens Minds equally enlightened; ſome ſee more than others, and ſome more clearly; nor is every degree of Light which ſhall be for the perfection of Saints hereafter, neceſſary while they are here in order to their Salvation. There may be the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith in the main, and of Love too, where yet there is ſome diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement about ſome things believed. It is confeſſed, that there is but one way of Salvation, that of Faith and Holineſs, from which whatever by-paths of error leads Men aſide, they do at the ſame time carry them off from the end of Faith, the Salvation of their Souls; whatever is inconſiſtent with either Faith or Holineſs, is inconſiſtent likewiſe with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But every difference, or miſtake about ſuch truths as are not neceſſarily ſaving, muſt not preſently be looked upon as a falſe way, or an error certainly Damning. The way to Life is called the <hi>narrow</hi> way, but is it therefore indiviſible? Is there no Latitude in it? may not Two, or Three, or Four, or Five, go abreſt in it? Muſt all go in the ſelf-ſame Track or Path? May not ſeveral Paths be in the ſame great Road, or run along by the ſide of it, and lead to the ſame place, which if ſometimes they decline a little from the Road, yet before the end, fall in again with it, and for the main are parallel to it? It is as certain that truth is <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,</hi> error is <hi>multiformis,</hi> truth is but one, and error is various, and whatever in the leaſt deflects from truth muſt be a degree of error; as it is that there can be but one perfectly ſtrait Line between any two Points. But may not a Line that divaricates a little from the ſtrait one, and is ſo far crooked, run in again to it? Doth any Saint on Earth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the whole of truth, without any miſtake ſo much as in leſſer things? Doth any keep exactly to the ſtrait Line, ſo as never to take a crooked ſtep, never in any thing to go off from it? Some indeed may miſs it in fewer things, ſome in more, and yet both, keeping to what is neceſſary, hit it in the main. Some may go to Heaven more directly, and with fewer wandrings, when others may go farther aſide, and fetch a greater compaſs, and yet at laſt arrive at it.</p>

               <pb n="963" facs="tcp:42587:383" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> by <hi>Religious,</hi> I underſtand thoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who <hi>as to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, hold the head,</hi> Col. 2.19. keep to that only foundation which God hath laid, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though perhaps they may build ſome things on it which are not ſuitable to it, <hi>Wood, Hay, Stubble,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.12. ſuch whoſe <hi>works ſhall be burnt,</hi> yet <hi>themſelves ſaved,</hi> though with difficulty, and <hi>as by Fire,</hi> verſe 15. ſuch I mean therefore as own ſo much truth as is neceſſary to the Life of Faith, and Power of Godlineſs, and maintain no error which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with either.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe who, <hi>as to the Practice of Chriſtianity, fear God and work righteouſneſs,</hi> Acts 10.35. they that not only believe in Chriſt, but live in obedience to him, not only <hi>have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,</hi> but <hi>walk in him.</hi> Col. 2.6. All true Religion conſiſts in Faith, and Holineſs, it is nothing elſe but a glorifying God, by believing and obeying; a ſeeking Salvation in that way, and method, in which alone God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring Men to it, <hi>i. e. through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13. whoever therefore they are that do unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and live up to that Faith, are truly Religious, though in ſome leſſer things they may diſſent from others, who have the ſame Faith, and practice the ſame Holineſs. So that from being thus religious, I exclude not only Atheiſts, that have no Religion, Idolaters, damnable Hereticks, and all thoſe whoſe principles are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, or repugnant to the truth of the Goſpel, &amp; ſo are of a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but even among thoſe that profeſs the truth, I exclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are <hi>groſly ignorant,</hi> know not the firſt principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, underſtand not what they own, and pretend to believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that are <hi>profane, ſcandalous, vitious livers,</hi> deſpiſers of them that are good, perſecutors of powerful godlineſs. Theſe are not real Saints, but a prophane generation; the Seed of the Serpent, not of God.—</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> masked profeſſors, that make a ſhew of Religion to ſerve a carnal intereſt, that <hi>have a form of godlineſs,</hi> but <hi>deny the power of it.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. have unſound hearts though under never ſo ſmooth faces. In a word, all thoſe that are deſtitute of true Faith, and real Holineſs, that allow themſelves in any way of known ſins, whether more often, as the ſecond ſort, or more ſecret and cloſe as theſe laſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How,</hi> or <hi>in what reſpects the religious of a Nation are the ſtrength of it.</hi> In order to the ſtating of this, I ſhall premiſe one diſtinction: The Holy Seed, or religious in a Nation may be conſidered, either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As being <hi>actually in the World, and actually in a ſtate of Grace;</hi> brought into Chriſts Fold, engaged in Gods ways, effectually called and ſanctified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or, <hi>as being in the World, but not yet converted,</hi> though in Gods time to be converted; elect unbelievers. He that is a ſinner at preſent, may be a Saint in time; a Publican may come to be an Apoſtle; nay a perſecutor of the Saints may be called to <hi>preach that Faith which once
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:42587:384" rendition="simple:additions"/> he deſtroyed,</hi> Gal. 1.23. They that are Chriſts Sheep by election, may in time, nay certainly muſt be ſo by actual calling, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> Or, <hi>as not yet actually in being in the World, but in the loyns of their Parents,</hi> whether Saints or Sinners: God may have a Seed even among the Children of wicked Men; and as ſometimes he may paſs by the Children of gracious Men, the Parents may be a Seed of God, and Children not; ſo ſometimes he may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the Parents, and take the Children, the Parents may be wicked and the Children holy. God is a Soveraign, and may chuſe where he will, and ſometimes he pitcheth upon the moſt unlikely Subjects; a wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> may have a godly <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for his Son, and a good <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> a wicked <hi>Jehoiachim</hi> for his. This diſtinction I lay down, becauſe though I underſtand the Doctrine in the firſt place of the religious actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in being among a People, yet not only of them, God ſometimes acting for a Nation with reſpect to thoſe he is to have among them: This premiſed, I come to ſhew in what reſpect the godly may be ſaid to be the ſtrength of a People, and this I ſhall by a little following the Metaphor in the Text. The Holy Seed, is here called the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> or <hi>Stock</hi> of a People, ſo that in what reſpect the ſtrength of a Tree is in its Stock, in thoſe, or ſeveral of them, the ſtrength of a People is in the Religion of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Stock of a Tree is <hi>the moſt firm and durable</hi> part of it; when the Leaves are ſhaken off, the Branches many of them drie, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, nay though it be cloſe Lopt, and all the Bows cut down, yet ſtill it continues, and lives, keeps its place, and retains its Sap. So it is with the truly religious at leaſt as to their Spiritual State (as we intimated in the explication of the Text) when Hypocrites, and Temporaries drop off from the Body of Profeſſors, and quit their Stations in a Church, and their religious Profeſſion, yet the godly ſtill continue, hold their own, keep their ſtanding. They are all united to Chriſt the Root, as well as to teach other in the Body, and as parts together of the ſame Stock, and ſo are preſerved, and continued in Life by Sap derived to them from the Root, the conſtant ſupplies of the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt. In this reſpect we may ſay, <hi>he that doth the will of God abideth for ever,</hi> 1 John 2.17. and, they that have <hi>an Unction from the Holy One, abide in him,</hi> verſe 20, 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Stock is that which propagates its kind,</hi> cut off all the Bows, and yet the Stem will ſhoot forth again, ſend out new Leaves, and Fruit; and Seed, from which other Trees will come. So here the righteous propagate their righteouſneſs, communicate to others, beget Children to God, are Spiritual Parents, and have a Spiritual Off-ſpring. How many Children come in upon their Parents Covenant, not only as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges in the Church, but as to real Grace? The <hi>promiſe</hi> is to them, <hi>and their Children,</hi> Acts 2.39. and as it takes place in all of them as to Church Memberſhip, ſo it doth in many as to Saintſhip. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides how many are wrought on by their inſtruction, won by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="965" facs="tcp:42587:384" rendition="simple:additions"/> awakened by their admonitions, overcome by their perſuaſions? How many have cauſe to bleſs God for religious Parents, religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, religious Inſtructors, (as well as godly Miniſters) who have been inſtrumental in their converſion? Thus when many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Branches of righteouſneſs are plucked off as to their temporal State in this Life, yet the Holy Seed continues, the Stock is pepetuated in a ſucceſſion of righteous ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men uſually ſpare the Tree for the ſake of the Stock,</hi> Iſa. 65.8. <hi>As the new Wine is in the Cluſter, and one ſaith deſtroy it not, a Bleſſing is in it;</hi> A Man finds a Cluſter or two of Grapes on a Vine, and by thoſe few perceives that there is Life in the Tree, and ſome hopes of more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs hereafter, and therefore doth not cut it down; <hi>ſo will I do ſays</hi> the Lord, <hi>for my Servants ſake, that I may not deſtroy them all,</hi> he ſpares the reſt, or many of them, doth not <hi>deſtroy them all, for his Servants ſake,</hi> for the ſake of the righteous among them, <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. according to marginal reading, <hi>The Innocent ſhall deliver the Iſland,</hi> which ſuits beſt with the following Clauſe, <hi>it is delivered by the pureneſs of my hands. Eliphaz</hi> tells <hi>Job</hi> before, what advantage he ſhould himſelf have by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God, and <hi>acquainting himſelf with him,</hi> verſe 21. from whom he ſuppoſes him to have departed, and to be eſtranged by ſin; and here he tells him what benefit ſhould redound to others; his goodneſs ſhould not only do good to himſelf but keep off evil from them. For the better underſtanding this, take two things by way of Conceſſion, and a third by way of Poſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I grant, that the <hi>religious part of a People may not always be active as Men, in a natural or civil way, in delivering them, or keeping off evils from them;</hi> they may have no proper and direct efficiency in it, for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes, <hi>they may want power and ability for it;</hi> they may be but few and inconſiderable for Number: the Holy Seed may be very thin ſown; there may be but a few Grains of Corn among a great deal of Chaff, but a little Wheat among abundance of Tares. Or, thoſe that are may be weak, and low as to their outward condition in the World, (for, <hi>not many mighty, not many noble, are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.) and ſo may be in ill caſe to contribute much by an active concurrence to the help of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes, <hi>they may be ſimple, and unskiful in outward affairs,</hi> want that Wiſdom, and Worldly Policy, which might be needful in many Caſes for the warding of imminent dangers, or removing incumbent troubles. <hi>Not many wiſe Men after the Fleſh are called,</hi> as well as not many mighty, or noble. Saints may be wiſe for their Souls, prudent and knowing in the Miſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet but Babes in other things. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> they have is <hi>from above, Jam.</hi> 3.17. &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects things above, and they may be meer Ignoramuſes in any thing elſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They may have no hand in publick affairs,</hi> no ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor be intruſted or made uſe of by thoſe that are in Power: they may be ſuppreſſed, and brought into bondage by others, as the
<pb n="966" facs="tcp:42587:385" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon:</hi> they may be ſo much in ſuffering by others that they be in no capacity of acting for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes, <hi>Gods Judgments upon a People may be ſuch as no Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo not the holieſt Men among them can keep them off by any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral efficiency,</hi> and all attempts in ſuch a way may be in vain. Such was the deſtruction of the Old World by the Flood, and of <hi>Sodom</hi> by Fire, and Brimſtone, and of ſeveral places by Inundations, Earthquakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I grant, that <hi>ſometimes the religious actually in being among a People may not be able by any means to</hi> deliver them, or keep off the greateſt evils from them. for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes, they cannot keep off ſuch evils from themſelves.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they may ſuffer as deeply as any in the common Calamities of a Nation, and periſh themſelves as to their outward condition, be cruſhed in the Ruins of the State where they are. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Baruch,</hi> could not hinder the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor prevent the Captivity of their Nation; but ſuffered themſelves in a great meaſure among them: And if we look to the external State of the beſt in the World, how often doth God <hi>deſtroy the perfect,</hi> as well as <hi>the wicked,</hi> Job 9.22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes the ſins of a People may be ſuch, that God will not pardon them as to temporal puniſhments,</hi> nay, not to the godly themſelves; even they may have been pertakers with others in their Sins, or may have ſo provoked God themſelves, and ſinned in ſuch a way as to cauſe <hi>his Name to be blaſphemed,</hi> ſo that he is concerned in honour to bring ſome exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſhment upon them. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. though he pardoned him as to the Guilt of Eternal Death, ſaved his Soul, and ſpared his Life which was forfeited to Divine Juſtice for the Murther of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that ſmart afflictions muſt come on him, <hi>the Sword</hi> muſt <hi>never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his houſe,</hi> verſe 10, and the Child begotten in Adultery muſt <hi>dye,</hi> verſe 10. and <hi>his Wives</hi> muſt be <hi>given to his Neighbours,</hi> verſe 11. ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8. it ſeems to be ſpoken of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and other godly among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who died in the Wilderneſs, and were not permitted to come into the Land of Promiſe, that God <hi>forgave them,</hi> yet <hi>took ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of their inventions,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. as God would not hear the Jews Prayers for themſelves, verſe 12. ſo, nor the Prophets Prayers for them, who is therefore forbid to Pray for them, verſe 11. and it is ſaid expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Sins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and particularly the Innocent Blood to ſhed, that <hi>God would not pardon them,</hi> 2 Kings 24.4. pardon them he did to <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who humbled himſelf for them, ſo as to ſave his Soul and remit his temporal puniſhment in part, for he brought him back from his Captivity, but to the Body of the People who had been perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with him in them, and never repented of them, he would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, but they muſt be deſtroyed, or go into Captivity. In this caſe the religious of a Nation may not be able by all their Interceſſions and with all their righteouſneſs to <hi>deliver</hi> any more than <hi>their
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:42587:385" rendition="simple:additions"/> own Souls,</hi> as is ſaid of <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> though ſo Eminently Holy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes <hi>God may make a difference between the Holy Seed, and the Sinners, in the ſame People, ſo as to Deliver the one, when he Deſtroys the other;</hi> ſo he provided for <hi>Noah,</hi> when he Drown'd the World, and ſaved <hi>Lot,</hi> when he Deſtroyed <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Chriſtians at <hi>Pella,</hi> when <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was Sack'd by <hi>Titus.</hi> God may ſometimes hide them, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth others; cover their Heads in the Day of Battails, when his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are ſharp in the Hearts of his Enemies. He may ſet a mark upon them that Cry and Sigh for the Abominations of a Land, and Command the Deſtroying Angel when he Slays others, Young and Old, and begins at the Sanctuary too, yet not to come near them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 6. By what hath been ſaid, it appears that the propoſition is not Univerſal, That God always ſpares a People for the ſake of the Holy Seed among them, at leaſt, that are not Actually in Being. I add therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of Poſition, That <hi>the Religious of a Nation, either that are, or are to be, among them, are frequently, ordinarily the means of a Peoples Deliverance, and when God ſpares the Sinners of his People, it is uſually for the ſake of the Saints;</hi> and were it not for them, he would not have any reſpect to the others, even as the Prophet would not have looked to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had it not been for the preſence of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 Kings 3.14.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes <hi>Judgments may be kept off from a People for their ſake.</hi> Had there been but <hi>Ten Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> God would have ſpared it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32. And he tells <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 5.1. That <hi>if there were any in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that Executed Judgment, and ſought the Truth, he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it. Jeremiah</hi> himſelf there was, and <hi>Baruch,</hi> and <hi>Ebimelech,</hi> and it may be ſome few others, but the generality were Corrupt, and the Godly ſo few, that they were next to none; none to ſpeak of (as we ſay) as few in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> proportionably, as in <hi>Sodom,</hi> in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and indeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. it is compared to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from this reaſon, among others; and <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.28. God calls them <hi>all grievous Revolters, all Corrupters;</hi> the few Righteous Ones among them are otherwiſe provided for, and they were a People whom God would not pardon, (as before was ſaid) and in Honour could not. And yet in another Caſe we find a City ſaved for the ſake of a Saint, Two Thouſand was not Deſtroyd at <hi>Lots</hi> Entreaty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes <hi>Judgments may be defer'd, and a Peoples Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility lengthned out, for the ſake of the Religious among them.</hi> There was to be Peace and Truth in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Days, though Dreadful Times to come after, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.8. And <hi>Joſiah</hi> was to go to his Grave in Peace, and not ſee the Evil that ſhould come after his Death, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20. God <hi>takes away the Righteous from the Evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. Which implies, that God defers the Evil till he hath taken the Righteous, and ſecured them: It was a ſign that Evil was coming on that People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Righteous periſhed, and it was their Sin that they did not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="968" facs="tcp:42587:386" rendition="simple:additions"/> it; the Death of the Righteous was the Fore-runner of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were defer'd while they Lived. While God hath any Corn in the Field, he keeps up the Hedges, but when that is once Houſed, he breaks down the Fence, and lets in the Beaſts. He may not <hi>ſweep</hi> a Land <hi>with the Beeſome of Deſtruction,</hi> Iſa. 14.23. for a time, becauſe he may have ſome Jewels among the Rubbiſh, but when he hath pick'd them up, he defers no longer. Thus, though he would not ſpare <hi>Sodom</hi> for <hi>Lots</hi> ſake, yet he delayd its Vengeance till he was clear of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. <hi>I can do nothing,</hi> ſays the Angel to him, <hi>till thou be come thither,</hi> i. e. to <hi>Zoar.</hi> And God would not bring on the Deluge till <hi>Noah</hi> were ſafe in the Ark. The <hi>Romans</hi> could not Conquer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were got out of it; and the Judgment of Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd till all Gods People be gone out from her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes <hi>Judgments, though they do come upon a People, yet may, for the ſake of the Godly among them, be abated, and leſſened, and mingled with Mercy.</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.22. <hi>for the Elects ſake, thoſe Days</hi> (Days of <hi>great Tribulation,</hi> verſe 21.) <hi>ſhall be ſhortned.</hi> And in <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time, God would <hi>not utterly Deſtroy them, but grant them ſome Deliverance,</hi> 2 Chron. 12.7. Partly becauſe <hi>they humbled themſelve,</hi> and withal, verſe 12. <hi>In</hi> Judah <hi>things went well,</hi> or, as the Margin reads it, <hi>Yet in</hi> Judah <hi>there were good things,</hi> they were not yet Univerſally corrupted, though they had much declined; there was ſtill a ſtock of Old Saints left, that did ſincerely cleave to God. So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.23. when God <hi>makes a Conſumption determined in the midſt of a Land, yet a Remnant ſhall be left.</hi> Verſe 22. And <hi>the Conſumption Decreed ſhall overflow with Righteouſneſs.</hi> And, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.8. when God <hi>deſtroys the Sinful Kingdom,</hi> yet he <hi>will not utterly deſtroy the Houſe of</hi> Jacob. And, <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. though he <hi>Sift the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>yet not the leaſt Grain ſhall fall to the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes <hi>God removes Judgments from off a People for the ſake of the Godly.</hi> So at leaſt, in part, for the ſake of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the reſt of the Faithful in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> God delivered the Land from <hi>Senacherib,</hi> with the Deſtruction of his Army, and himſelf ſoon after, when he had <hi>taken all the Fenced Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.1. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.4. &amp; 15.36, 38. Only it is worth our Obſerving here, That God hath in ſuch Caſes a reſpect to his Saints, whether Dead, or Alive, or yet unborn; ſo in Delivering <hi>Judah</hi> out of the hand of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> he had reſpect not only to the Righteous of a Nation, then in Being, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah, &amp;c.</hi> but to <hi>David,</hi> though long ſince Dead, (having promiſed a Kingdom to be continued to his Poſterity, he would make good his word,) nay to thoſe that were yet to come. <hi>Verſe</hi> 31, 32. <hi>The Remnant that is eſcaped of the Houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>ſhall again take Root downward, and bear Fruit upward. For out of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall go forth a Remnant,</hi> this <hi>Remnant</hi> were not only they that were then Living, and eſcaped <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Fury, but many that were yet to come; all that eſcaped the preſent Danger were not Godly, but yet Godly
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:42587:386" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ones were to be Born of them. And is it not great Truth, that in all the Deliverances of that Nation, as God had a ſpecial regard to Chriſt that was to proceed from them, according to the Fleſh, ſo likewiſe to the Elect he had, from Eternity, given to Chriſt, and which were to be in their ſeveral Generations, and Succeſſions, a <hi>Seed to ſerve him,</hi> Pſal. 22.30. Other Inſtances might here be brought, but I ſhall meet with them under another Head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſtock of the Tree is that for the ſake of which the Tree is dreſs'd, and water'd, and look'd after;</hi> Men take care of the Trees ſo long as there is Life in the ſtock; they do not only not grub it up, but prune it, and beſtow upon it what Coſt and Labour is fit for it. Many a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, both Temporal, and Spiritual, comes upon a Nation for the ſake of the Religious, in the midſt of it. Who watcheth, or waters a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, when all the Vines are Dead? When the ſtem of the Vine is Alive, though many Branches be withered, they may lay open the Root, and Dung it, and all the Labour they beſtow upon it, is for the ſake of the Life they ſee in the Body of it. That God <hi>keeps his Vineyard, and waters it every Moment,</hi> Iſa. 27.3. It is becauſe he ſees Life in the Plants, though there be little Fruit on the Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Temporal good things.</hi> We find him ſometimes beſtowing upon others, for the ſake of the Godly that are with them; as he Bleſſed <hi>Laban,</hi> though an Idolater, for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.20. And <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> for <hi>Joſephs, Chap.</hi> 39.5. Peace and Plenty he may afford to a People, that his own Servants may have their ſhare of it, for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in Holineſs. So, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 29.7. that <hi>Babylon</hi> had ſo long Peace before its Downfal, it was, that Gods People in it might have Peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual.</hi> God gives the means of Grace, his Oracles and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the offers of Salvation to a People, eſpecially for the ſake of thoſe that belong to him. It is no ſmall Mercy to have an External Call, an offer of Chriſt, to be brought into a Salvable Condition: if Men neglect their Opportunities, forſake their own Mercys, loſe the Benefit of them, it is their own Fault; the Privilege is not leſs in it ſelf. Now where God hath none to call Effectually, he doth not uſe to ſend the Goſpel; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>forbidden by the Holy-Ghoſt to Preach the Word in</hi> Aſia, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6. and when he would have gone into <hi>Bithynnia, the Spirit ſuffered</hi> him <hi>not,</hi> Verſ. 7. and why was it? But becauſe God had not any People there who were as yet to be called by his Grace: But he is ſent into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Verſe 10. becauſe there God had work for him, ſeveral that were preſently to be Converted by his Miniſtry. Had not God had a Seed among the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they might have ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame Darkneſs that the others were in. So likewiſe God continued <hi>Paul</hi> ſo long at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and tells him that <hi>no Man ſhould ſet on him to hurt him,</hi> becauſe he had <hi>much People</hi> in that <hi>City,</hi> Acts 18.10.</p>
            <pb n="970" facs="tcp:42587:387"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If it be ask'd, Why doth God ſhew ſuch reſpect to others, for the ſake of the Godly? Not to mention other Reaſons here, I will give but Two,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In reſpect of the <hi>Godly which are to be gathered in,</hi> he doth it, <hi>that they may be gathered.</hi> Many Saints may be in the Loins of Wicked Men, (as hath been ſaid) and ſhould God cut off the Parents, the Children would never have a Being, or ſhould he not continue the means of Grace to them, how ſhould thoſe that come of them be Converted? And therefore he keeps off ſuch Evils from the Parents, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent either the Birth, or the Converſion of ſuch as are to be Born of them, and beſtows upon them ſuch Bleſſings and Privileges, as may promote, and further it. He ſpares, and dreſſes the Tree, for the ſake of the Fruit he intends it ſhall bring forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. In relation to thoſe <hi>that are already called,</hi> God ſhews kindneſs to others for their ſakes, <hi>that there may be time and opportunity for all the Work he hath determined to do, either in, or by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In them.</hi> A People may be ſpared, that they may be ſpared among them, and ſhare in their Deliverance, and the means of Grace may be continued to the Body of a People, till God hath wrought all that Grace in the hearts of his Children, which he hath deſigned for them. Should they fall with others, or ſhould the means of Grace be taken away, they ſhould want them, and what were <hi>lacking</hi> in their Graces would not be <hi>made up.</hi> God therefore uſually continues the Goſpel to a People, ſo long as there are any among them to be called in, or built up, and when he takes it away from a Nation, it is a ſign it hath done all its work there which he ſent it to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By them.</hi> That they may have opportunity for doing what God appointed them to do. Were they taken off with others, they ſhould not have time for their Work, were they continually under Preſſures, always loaded with Afflictions, they might be diſheartned in it, were the means of Grace gone, they might want quickning to it; nay, ſhould God take away the whole Set of Wicked Men from them, they ſhould want much matter for their Graces to work upon. Much of the Grace of the Saints, reſpects their Enemies, Love to them, Meekneſs and Gentleneſs in dealing with, Patience in bearing Injuries from them, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in reproving their Vices, and Zeal in oppoſing, or hindering their Wickedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And God may ſpare them ſometimes, that they may be matter on which the Graces of the Saints may be exerciſed, and thereby the Excellency of a true Chriſtian Spirit diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>On what account the Religious of a Nation may be ſaid to be its ſtrength,</hi> or what Influence they have on the welfare, and ſecurity of a People; and this will yet farther Evidence the truth of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As they are Gods Favourites,</hi> his Children, his <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.16. His <hi>Treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19.5. His <hi>Portion,</hi> Deut. 32.9. They are moſt nearly Related to him, moſt dearly Beloved by him. And though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe Titles are Attributed to the Body of a People, yet they
<pb n="971" facs="tcp:42587:387" rendition="simple:additions"/> primarily belong to the truly Religious among them, and either are given to the reſt, with reſpect to them, or only according to what they appear to be, though in reality they are not. The Godly have the greateſt Intereſt in God, as well as he hath an Intereſt in them, and therefore they can do moſt with him, and he doth moſt upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Men will many times uſe their Servants well for their Childrens ſake; be kind to a ſtranger whom they know not, for the ſake of a Friend whom they do know: ſave their Bags, or Trunks, though little worth, if their Jewels or Treaſure be in them; and Princes will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie whole Societies for the ſake of ſome particular Favourites. God is not leſs concerned for his Friends, and Favourites, than Men are for theirs; and many a Boon (ſo to ſpeak) he gives to others, out of the reſpect he bears to them. Men are Ambitious of being great, and thoſe that have an Intereſt in Princes, to be Members of their Communities, and Corporations, becauſe they reckon the whole will fare the better for their ſakes, and many ſpecial Privileges may be Indulged them in Favour to ſuch Honourable Members. Why ſhould they not Judg the ſame in the Caſe before us? Is not God wont to do as much for thoſe he Loves, as Men do for thoſe they Love? Happy is that Society where God hath many Friends, if Men be but ſo wiſe as to be Friendly to them. It is pity but that the Favourites of Heaven ſhould be their Favourites too. <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> thought ſo (though an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then) when he would make a <hi>Covenant with</hi> Iſaac, becauſe he ſaw that <hi>the Lord was him,</hi> Gen. 26.28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As they Improve their Intereſt with God for a People.</hi> They are they that Intercede with God for them: <hi>ſtand in the Gap, and make up the Hedg,</hi> (Ezek. 22.30.) when by other means they cannot, yet by Prayer, that ſo God may <hi>not deſtroy them.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> interpoſed with God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when under Gods great diſpleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. And <hi>Abraham</hi> Pray'd for <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Houſhold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. And <hi>Samuel</hi> for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould Sin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to Pray for you.</hi> And ſtill the Religious part of a People, are the Praying part of them, and thereby do moſt for them; they Pray moſt, and beſt, and to beſt purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Moſt.</hi> Pſal. 109.4. <hi>I give my ſelf to Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>[I Prayer,]</hi> as if he had ſaid, I am all Prayer, Prayer is my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my whole work. Prayer indeed is the very breath of the New Man, a Prayerleſs Perſon is never a Religious One, no more than a Child can be Alive which doth not Breath. No ſooner did <hi>Paul</hi> ceaſe Perſecuting the Godly, and came to be in the number of them himſelf, but he fell a Praying, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. And generally, the moſt Eminent in Holineſs are moſt Eminent in Prayer, but ſtill they that are really Gods People, are a Praying People. Others may Pray by fits, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; others may <hi>viſit</hi> him <hi>in their trouble,</hi> and when his <hi>chaſtening is upon them,</hi> Iſa. 26.16. But they do it, even when the greateſt Bleſſings are upon them; others Cry to him when they need him moſt, but they
<pb n="972" facs="tcp:42587:388" rendition="simple:additions"/> even when they ſeem to need him leaſt; they Pray <hi>always,</hi> Epheſ. 6.18. <hi>Without ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. And that not only for themſelves only, but for others, for their Enemies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And much more for their Neighbours, and thoſe of the ſame Community with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And that not only,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>they are themſelves concern'd in their welfare,</hi> as being of the ſame Body, and ſo count it their Intereſt, the welfare of the whole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the welfare of the Members.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But <hi>becauſe they love others, and pity them,</hi> and out of Compaſſion Pray for them; they are Friends and Well-wiſhers to them, and would have them partake of their Mercies; they grudg them not the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greateſt good things; would have them be as good as themſelves, as much in the Favour of God as themſelves, and every way as Happy, and therefore Beg that they may be ſo: It grieves them to ſee the Miſery of others, when they themſelves are moſt ſecure, moſt free from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They have tried Prayer moſt,</hi> both for themſelves and others, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the ſweetneſs and efficacy of it. They Pray becauſe they have Pray'd, and their Prayers have not been in vain; and they Pray for others, becauſe they have been heard for others, as well as Pray for themſelves, becauſe they have been heard for tthemſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They Pray beſt.</hi> Grace will out Pray nature. In Carnal Men Prayer is but the Voice of Nature, or Conſcience, but in the Godly it is the Language of Grace. Others make Prayers, theſe only Pray Prayers. Others Pray either in their Forms, or in their Gifts, or their Parts; theſe only <hi>Pray in the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> Jude 1.20. And this too I underſtand not only of their Praying for themſelves, but likewiſe for others. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They have moſt to plead with God for others,</hi> or know beſt what to plead. They that are beſt acquainted with the Word, have moſt <hi>Obſerved the Operations of Gods Hands,</hi> Pſ. 28.5. the Methods of his Providence, the Iſſue of his various Diſpenſations in the World; thoſe that are moſt Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirited, ſo as to concern themſelves moſt for the welfare of others, eſpecially of Gods People, and for the Glory of his Name, have moſt to plead with God on their behalf; and ſo moſt Materials, and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for Prayer, and moſt Arguments for Faith, to preſent to God in Prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They have Faith to urge their pleas,</hi> they are indeed the only Perſons that have true Faith, and it is Faith eſpecially makes Men plead with God, and improve all the Arguments they can, ſo far as the Word, which is the ground of Faith, will warrant them: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> pleads for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 32.11, 12, 13. And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Caſe of the Famine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.7, 8. The more Faith in Prayer, uſually the more pleading in it. And this Prayer is always beſt, becauſe of the Faith that is Acted in it. The goodneſs of Prayer is not to be Judged of by the Curiouſneſs of the Compoſition, the Elegancy of the Stile, the
<pb n="973" facs="tcp:42587:388" rendition="simple:additions"/> Vehemency of the Expreſſion, but by the workings of Faith. It is the Prayer of Faith that is called for, and to which the promiſe is made, <hi>James</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They urge them with moſt fervency.</hi> There is a natural fervency in Prayer, which ariſeth from natural affections, excited and quickned by ſome preſſing trouble or diſtreſs; and there is a gracious fervency which proceeds from Faith: nothing makes Men more earneſt, and warm in Prayer than Faith doth; the more firmly a Man believe, the more importunately he asks; the greater hope he hath of prevailing, the more vehement he will be in begging. It was <hi>Jacobs</hi> Faith made him ſo importunate in Prayer; that he wreſtled with God, and would not let him go unleſs he Bleſſed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. for he had a promiſe of being bleſt, and all Nations in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.13, 14. it was the Faith of that Promiſe ſtir'd up this Fervency. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>importunity</hi> in Prayer, the Syrophenician Woman, is no leſs an example of Faith, verſe 28. <hi>O Woman great is thy Faith.</hi> So that we may conclude, the religious of a People Pray beſt, becauſe both with true Faith, and ſpiritual Fervency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They Pray to beſt purpoſe,</hi> with moſt ſucceſs. If ever any Prayer be effectual, it is <hi>the fervent Prayer of a righteous Man, Jam.</hi> 5.16. which is the ſame with <hi>the Prayer of Faith,</hi> verſe 15. when God abhors the Prayers of others, he hath reſpect to his; when <hi>the ſacrifice of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is an abomination to him,</hi> the <hi>Prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Pet. 15.8. <hi>He fulfills the deſires of thoſe that fear him, he hears their cry and ſaves them,</hi> Pſal. 145.19. They Pray <hi>according to his Will,</hi> and <hi>he hears them,</hi> 1 John 5.14. They having moſt Intereſt in God (as before) can prevail moſt with him, and get moſt of him. The Favourites of a Prince will many times prevail with him, when the Petitions of common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and much more of rebels, are rejected by him. The prevalency of godly Mens Prayers is well known, and hath been often experienced by their Enemies themſelves, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf believed it when he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Moſes</hi> Prayers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.28. and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> when <hi>Peters,</hi> Acts 8.24. ſuch are conſcious to themſelves of their want of an Intereſt in God, and their being obnoxious to him, and that the truly godly are in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with him, and therefore when their hearts fail them, and they have not the Face to look up to God, they will beg the Prayers of thoſe that have, when they are in great diſtreſſes, or dangers, on ſick Beds, when Conſcience teiſeth them, Death looks grimly on them, Hell gapes for them, and Heaven frowns upon them, then they muſt have ſome good Men to Pray for them: they think God is ready to hear ſuch when he is angry with themſelves. Thus, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Saul</hi> would have <hi>Samuel</hi> come back, and worſhip with him; he thought God was angry with him, and would not look to him, but <hi>Samuel</hi> might be accepted. It was a good Teſtimony given by a Queen to the efficacy of the Saints Prayers, when ſhe profeſſed her ſelf more afraid of one poor Miniſter in the Pulpit, than of a numerous Army in the Field. And
<pb n="974" facs="tcp:42587:389" rendition="simple:additions"/> a good Biſhop once told a great King concerning a godly Gentleman that was under ſome disfavour for his plain ſpeaking, that he had not a better Subject in his Kingdom, being a Man <hi>that could have what he would of God.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves took notice of the prevalency of the Prayers of the Chriſtian Legion among them, in that great deliverance obtained by them in the time of the Emperour <hi>Marcus.</hi> It is uſually a ſign of Mercy to a Perſon, or People, when God opens, and enlarges the hearts of his Servants in Prayer for them: When God intends to do them good, he puts it into the hearts of ſuch to ſeek it for them. When the time of the Jews return from their Captivity drew neer, he ſet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> at work to Pray for it, chap. 9.1, 2, 3. And it is as bad a ſign when the hearts of the godly are ſhut up, and ſtraitned, ſo that either they drop others out of their Prayers, or cannot be earneſt with God for them; he doth as it were ſecretly forbid them to Pray for ſuch, he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them by withdrawing his Spirit from them: The Mercies he gives out to others, being frequently at the requeſt of his Saints, when he ſtops thoſe requeſts, it is a ſign he hath no Mercy for thoſe for whom they were to be made: when a Petition is prevented, it is a ſign it ſhould not have been granted. When God doth not <hi>prepare</hi> his Servants <hi>hearts,</hi> he doth not <hi>incline his own ear,</hi> Pſal. 10.17. As on the other ſide, when he intends to hear, he ſtirs up Prayer, even as Princes will ſometimes give a private intimation to thoſe for whom they deſign a Favour, to Petition them for it. To conclude this, the ſumm of all is, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of a Nation are upon this account the Strength of it, ſo that they Pray moſt, and with beſt ſucceſs for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As they are a means many times to ſtop the current of wickedneſs, which is ready to overflow a Land with Judgments,</hi> and to bring ſwift deſtruction on it, for they are thereby a means to prevent or leſſen thoſe Judgments. It is the Sin of a People that lays them open to wrath, and he that would keep off wrath, muſt endeavour to keep out ſin; he that would hinder the effect, muſt obviate the cauſe. It is the Devils damnable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to draw Men into Sin, that he may expoſe them to puniſhment; this he taught his Diſciple <hi>Baalam,</hi> who taught the <hi>Midianites</hi> to <hi>caſt a ſtumbling-block before the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and commit fornication,</hi> Rev. 2.14. he could not otherwiſe hurt that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than by ſetting God againſt them, and that he could not do by any means, but bringing them to ſin againſt him. None are greater Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a People, nor can go a readier way to ruin them (of which more hereafter) than they that draw them into Sin, and thereby into Gods diſpleaſure: and on the other hand, none are greater Friends to them than they that labour moſt to keep them from Sin, for that is the ſureſt way to keep them from ſuffering; or, in the words of <hi>Phineas</hi> in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 22.31. <hi>to deliver them out of the hand of the Lord, i. e.</hi> to keep them from falling into it. Now who is it that hinders Sin moſt, and ſtops the Dam to prevent an Inundation of it, but the religious part of a Nation? It is they that reprove it, and bear their Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:42587:389" rendition="simple:additions"/> it, and by their Authority (ſo far as they are in a capacity) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, and by their example diſcountenance it. None ſo active, none ſo zealous in oppoſing Sin as they that are moſt Holy: They not only fear it in themſelves, but labour to prevent it in others, if it were in their power, they would neither Sin themſelves, nor let any elſe, though they ſet themſelves eſpecially againſt the moſt crying Sins, and which are moſt like to ſtir up wrath in God againſt a People: And when Sin is that for which threatnings are denounced, and puniſhments inflicted, they that fear God among any People, do moſt effectually keep off puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by preventing Sin. To prevent it therefore is their firſt care, and if that cannot be, they bewail it, and mourn over it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. they <hi>ſigh and cry for the abominations</hi> of a <hi>Land.</hi> So <hi>David beheld the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and was grieved,</hi> Pſal. 119.158. <hi>Rivers ran down his Eyes becauſe they kept not Gods Laws,</hi> verſe 136. and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 13.17. <hi>wept in ſecret places,</hi> for the <hi>pride</hi> of his People. This is not a direct, and formal ſtopping the courſe of Sin in a Land in reſpect of others; yet it is a kind of check to it ſo far as it keeps Sin from being ſo general as to overſpread themſelves: while they thus lay to heart the Sins of others, they are not themſelves partakers of them, nor ſharers in the Guilt. Theſe Sins are not univerſal, when there are ſome that teſtifie their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of them by their ſorrow for them. The more general Sin is, the more dangerous, and the more like to bring on Judgments, when the godly themſelves become guilty, though not by commiſſion of it, yet by not bewailing it, which is a degree of fellowſhip with it. But when they mourn for Sin committed by others, they free themſelves from the guilt of approbation, or connivance at, or communion in it, and ſo may be inſtrumental in keeping off, at leaſt more general Judgments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As they not only check the progreſs of Sin, but <hi>propagate goodneſs to others,</hi> as well as promote it in themſelves: this they do by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, admonitions, example. They make it their buſineſs not only to do good themſelves, but to make others good, and bring them to Holineſs, as well as keep them from Sin, and ſo not only themſelves live in the exerciſe of theſe Graces to which the promiſes are made, <hi>executing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſeeking the truth,</hi> Jer. 5.1. but they labour to gain others to the ſame gracious converſation. Grace, wherever it is, is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſpreads it ſelf what it can; they that love God, ſee ſo much love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in him, that they would fain perſwade others to love him too: they that walk in his ways like them ſo well, and find ſo much peace and pleaſantneſs in them, and expect ſuch a reward at the end of them, that they are ſolicitous to get others into them: they know he whom they ſerve is bountiful enough, and rich enough, there is Glory enough in Heaven for all, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>Manſions</hi> enough in Chriſts <hi>Fathers Houſe</hi> for all, and the multitude of Fellow-Servants will neither hinder their Work, nor diminiſh their Wages, nay they know that <hi>they that win Souls are wiſe, they that turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3. and therefore they are deſirous to be in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="976" facs="tcp:42587:390" rendition="simple:additions"/> of them. It is their deſign to advance Gods Name, and Glory, and they would have others help them in the Work. And indeed God often makes uſe of not only Miniſters in their Preaching, but private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their converſation, to promote the converſion of Sinners, and commonly when he intends any great reformation among a People, he makes uſe of thoſe that are already gracious in carrying it on: And <hi>godlineſs having the promiſes of the Life that now is,</hi> as well as of <hi>that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8. ſo far as the religious part of a People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote godlineſs, advance Religion among them, ſo far they are inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in procuring their welfare, and keeping off their ruin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sometimes the religious of a Nation may have an influence upon its publick welfare, <hi>by doing ſome eminent ſervice wherewith God is much pleaſed, and to what he hath a ſpecial reſpect,</hi> Pſal. 106.30. <hi>Princes ſtood up, and executed judgment, and ſo the plague was ſtayed,</hi> &amp; Numb. 25. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas <hi>hath turned away my wrath from the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>while he was zealous for my ſake among them, that I conſumed them not,</hi> and verſe 13. he is ſaid to <hi>make an attonement</hi> for them by that Act: not that any thing done by a meer Man, can be a full ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice for a Mans own Sin, and much leſs can it for the Sin of another, but however, as ſometimes temporal evils inflicted upon Saints themſelves, becauſe they have a reſpect to their Sins, though they are not properly penal, yet in a larger Sence are called <hi>puniſhments,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>vengeance,</hi> Pſal. 99.8. <hi>thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou tookeſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of their inventions, Moſes</hi> himſelf ſeems to be included, verſe 6.7. here was <hi>vengeance</hi> on thoſe who yet were <hi>pardoned,</hi> which cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſtrictly ſuch; ſo likewiſe ſome good the Saints do which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and accepted of him in Chriſt, on the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he turns away his anger (thereby to ſhew his approbation of what is done, and to encourage to more) and this may in the ſame large Sence be called an attonement, though properly it be not ſo. Yet this Act of <hi>Phineas</hi> hath ſomething in it that reſembles an attonement, and may on that account be ſo called, for his killing <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi</hi> was a fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Law, which required the Death of the Parties offending on ſuch a kind, and the holineſs of God which had been contemned by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, was in ſome meaſure vindicated, and in the eyes of the People by their exemplary puniſhment. Another inſtance we have in <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> chap. 7. the Lord was angry with <hi>Iſrael</hi> for <hi>Achans</hi> treſpaſs, verſe 12: <hi>Joſhuah</hi> hath him ſtoned to death, verſe 25. and then verſe 26. <hi>the Lord turned from the fierceneſs of his anger.</hi> So, when there was a Famine in the Land for <hi>Sauls</hi> killing the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.1. <hi>David</hi> hangs up ſeven of his Sons, verſe 9. and then verſe 14. the Lord <hi>was entreated for the Land.</hi> When ſuch Sins as are publick defilements to a Land are not puniſhed, the whole Land becomes guilty, and uſually is viſited with ſome publick judgment, but when they are puniſhed, that judgment is either prevented, or removed. No queſtion but <hi>Joſiahs</hi> Zeal in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, and deſtroying Idolatry wherewith the Land was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="977" facs="tcp:42587:390" rendition="simple:additions"/> polluted, had a great influence on the keeping off Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from it while he lived.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, God may ſometimes ſpare a People for the ſake of his Children among them, that <hi>they may be uſeful, and helpful to them in his work.</hi> This end God had in ſparing the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> he intended they ſhould be hewers of Wood, and drawers of Water for his Sanctuary, and ſo aſſiſtant to the Prieſts, and Levites in their Service. So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.5, 6. <hi>Strangers ſhall ſtand, and feed your Flocks, and the Sons of Aliens ſhall be your Plowmen and Vine-dreſſers, but ye ſhall be named the Prieſts of the Lord, Men ſhall call you the Miniſters of our God.</hi> Not that Saints are to be all Officers, or all Rulers, and carnal Men their Slaves, and Drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (for as to their worldly State, worldly Men may be above them, and they may owe ſubjection to them) but that they ſhall be in their worldly Employments, and Callings, uſeful, and ſerviceable to the Saints in the things of God, and either of their own accord, or as overruled by Divine diſpoſal, be aſſiſtant to them in maintaining and promoting the intereſt of true Religion. God can make even <hi>Moab hide his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts,</hi> Iſa. 16.3, 4. <hi>the Earth helps the Woman,</hi> Rev. 12.16. <hi>Ahab</hi> favours a good <hi>Obadiah</hi> that may hide the Lords Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.3, 4. an Heathen <hi>Cyrus let go his Captives, and build his City,</hi> Iſa. 45.13. a <hi>Darius,</hi> an <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> an <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> countenance and prefer a <hi>Daniel,</hi> a <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> a <hi>Mordecai,</hi> publick inſtruments of good to his People, ſometimes God may raiſe up ſuch on purpoſe, as he did <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſometimes preſerve, and maintain them in their power, and places, for his Servants ſake, and that they may be helpful to them. Nay, ſometimes he may ſo twiſt, and combine the intereſt of worldly Men with the intereſt of his Children, that they cannot promote their own, without helping on the others. Sometimes religious, and civil Liberties may be both together ſtruck at, ſo that if the former go down, the latter will be ruin'd too, and then it is the Wiſdom of thoſe that are not truly religious, yet to favour thoſe that are, it being as it were in their own defence, and for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, and in ſuch a caſe God may help them out of reſpect to his own, and keep ſome from civil ſlavery, that he may keep others from ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. By way of <hi>information.</hi> If the religious of a Nation are the Strength and Defence of it, then <hi>the ſame may be ſaid of the religious of the World,</hi> they are the ſubſtance of it, the ſupport; the ſtrength of it. The World it ſelf is preſerved chiefly for the ſake of the godly in it, the Holy Seed. The World is a great Field, in which the good Grain bears but a ſmall proportion to the abundance of Tares, and that God doth not pluck up the Tares, and burn them, it is, leſt the good Corn ſhould be plucked up with them. What is Gods end in preſerving the World, and holding it up in its being; but the glorifying himſelf in his ſeveral attributes, Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs, but eſpecially his Holineſs in the Service he enables his Saints to do him, and his Grace is the Salvation he affords them? that therefore he may have that Glory, it is needful there
<pb n="978" facs="tcp:42587:391" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhould be a continuance of ſome to ſerve him, and that may be the ſubjects of his Mercy and Grace, and they are this Elect, thoſe <hi>Veſſels of Mercy whom he hath before prepared unto Glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23. The World therefore ſhall ſtand ſo long as there be any of Gods Elect in it to be brought in by actual converſion, or their Graces to be completed in further degrees of Sanctification; but when the number of thoſe whoſe Names are written in Heaven, is filled up, and they themſelves fitted for Heaven, then ſhall the end of all things come. It cannot be thought that God would ever endure ſo much wickedneſs as he ſees in the World every day committed, or ſo long bear its manners with ſo much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, had he not a further deſign in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the gathering together the whole Body of thoſe he hath given to Chriſt. He never made this great Fabrick for the luſts and pleaſures of wicked Men, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their eaſe, and gratifie their ſences, and devour their neighbours, but for his own Glory; and he will have ſome ſtill in it to glorifie him by ſerving him, and living according to his Laws, as well as he glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf in ſaving them, and were there none in it to ſerve him, he would not ſuffer others continually to diſhonour him; were it not for the Holy Seed he hath ſcattered abroad in it, he would ſoon ſet the Field on a Flame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Religious of a Nation are not its Enemies, not the troublers of a Nation,</hi> not the Peſts of a State, the diſturbers of a Peace, as ſome count them. <hi>Ahab</hi> indeed reviled <hi>Elijah</hi> as one that <hi>troubled</hi> Iſrael, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.17. but <hi>David</hi> would not have ſaid ſo, he was a godly King, and had other thougts of his godly Subjects, he calls them the <hi>excellent of the Earth, and his delight</hi> was in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. the Jews ſaid of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.6. that they had <hi>turned the world upſide down,</hi> but they were unbeleiving Jews that ſaw it. The ſame Apoſtles were counted <hi>the Off-ſcouring of all things, and the Filth of the Earth.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.13. but it was by thoſe that rather were ſuch themſelves. The Idolatrous Heathens were wont to condemn the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as the cauſe of all their publick calamities that befel them, but they were Heathens that did ſo. Yet ſometimes we ſhall find wicked Men themſelves under a conviction of the contrary, and clearing them of this imputation; ſo <hi>Joaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> calls <hi>Elijah the Chariot of</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>and the Horſemen thereof.</hi> Sometimes (as before) they beg their Prayers; ſometimes wiſh themſelves in their condition, and whatever they eſteem them while they live, they would be like them when they die, wicked <hi>Baalam</hi> would <hi>die the death of the righteous,</hi> Numb. 23.10. Thus Conſcience abſolves whom Malice had condemned, and when Men come to be cool and ſober, they purge the godly from thoſe crimes, with which while they were heated with paſſion, or intoxicated with a concern for ſome contrary intereſt, they had groundleſly aſperſed them. True indeed, the Religious of a People almoſt every where are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diviſions, and Diſtractions; and ſo was Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>he came to ſend Fire on the Earth,</hi> verſe 49. <hi>and not to give Peace, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:42587:391" rendition="simple:additions"/> Diviſion,</hi> verſe 51. nay, <hi>a Sword,</hi> Matth. 10.34. <hi>to ſet a Man at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance againſt his Father,</hi> &amp;c. verſe 35. And yet, nor Chriſt, nor his Saints are really the troublers of the World, nor the direct, and proper cauſes of thoſe broyls and confuſions which many times have been made on their accounts, which indeed proceed from the luſts of the wicked, not the Graces of the godly: Sinners cannot endure the Light of the Truth, nor the power of Holineſs in the Lives of Saints, and therefore quarrel with them, but are thoſe Saints to be blamed for ſuch troubles as only accidentally, and by reaſon of the corruptions of others ariſe on their doing but their Duty? Is a Bridge to be blamed for troubling the Water, becauſe keeping its place it ſtops the Waters paſſage, and is the occaſion of its ſwelling and roaring? Are Sheep to be blamed for incenſing the Wolves? Or Doves, for provoking the Hawks? Truly, juſt ſuch incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are Gods Children in the places where they live, they diſquiet their Neighbours only by the good things they enjoy, which others love and covet, and fain would get from them, or by the good they do which wicked Men hate and fain would hinder in them. The quarrels of the ungodly World with the Holy Seed among them, are but like that of <hi>Cain</hi> with <hi>Abel,</hi> he ſlew his Brother, <hi>becauſe his own works were evil, and his Brothers righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Sinners of a Nation are really the weakneſs of it.</hi> It is they of whatſoever Party, or Sect, or perſuaſion they are, that troubles any People, and occaſions their dangers, and procure their ruin. <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exalts a Nation,</hi> Prov. 14.34. it is Sin that is a reproach to it, that humbles it, and brings it down. Wicked Men are they that betray Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, expoſe them to Gods wrath, ſubject them to his judgments. Did <hi>Noah</hi> bring the Flood upon the old World, or did the wicked of it by their wickedneſs? Did <hi>Lot</hi> bring down Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> or did the Sodomites do it by their own lewdneſs? Did <hi>Jeremiah</hi> by his Preaching, or <hi>Baruch,</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> and thoſe few other godly in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by their Praying, and Weeping, and Mourning, bring on the Captivity of that People, or did not they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Idolatry, their Prophaneneſs, their Swearing, their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaking, their polluting Gods Ordinances, their ſhedding Innocent Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians the cauſe of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or were not the unbelieving Jews by their rejecting Chriſt, and perſecuting thoſe that adhered to him? I deny not but the Sins of the beſt of Saints may ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the bringing down judgments upon others, <hi>Jonahs</hi> Sin raiſed a Tempeſt upon the Mariners, chap. 1. and <hi>David</hi> numbring the People brought the Plague upon them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. God will not only manifeſt his own Holineſs by puniſhing them that are deareſt to him, when they Sin againſt him, but teach them more care, &amp; watchfulneſs againſt Sin, when they find how far the direful effects of it are extended unto others. And yet what is this to the numerous inſtances on the other ſide? Which doth ordinarily do moſt miſchief, the Sins of the truly godly which are fewer,
<pb n="990" facs="tcp:42587:392" rendition="simple:additions"/> and leſſer, and mourned over, and repented of, or the Sins of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, the Hypocrites, the Impenitent? May we not ſay, that if the Sins of the one have ſlain their Thouſands, thoſe of the other have ſlain their Ten-Thouſands? The greateſt danger any can be in, is to be liable to the diſpleaſure of God, who is Holy, and cannot endure to behold iniquity, powerful, and able to deſtroy thoſe that offend him, can Arm, and Commiſſion innumerable Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, raiſe the <hi>Poſſe</hi> of Heaven and Earth upon them, let flie Thouſands of Arrows at them, and command what judgments he pleaſe to conſume them; And who are they that do ordinarily make a People naked, and lay them open to the Wrath, and Revenge of God? Is it they that love God, or they that hate him? the obedient, or the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, they that pleaſe him, or they that provoke him, they that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with him, or they they that defie him, they that mourn for the abominations of a Land, or they that commit and encourage them, they that tremble at his judgments, or that dare his vengeance; In a Word, they that hinder all the Sin they can, or that hinder all the good they can, they that dare not be wicked, or that will not be Holy?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is the Intereſt of any People where God hath a Seed of righteous ones, to favour them, and make much of them.</hi> They are their beſt Friends that are Gods Friends. They ſhould favour them moſt whom God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, of whoſe good things they partake, for whoſe ſakes they are preſerved, receive many a mercy, enjoy many a privilege, eſcape ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a judgment. It is their intereſt to be kind to thoſe that have moſt intereſt in God, moſt power with him, and can get moſt of him. What Society of Men but uſually favours them moſt whom their Prince favour moſt, and they think it their intereſt to do ſo? They know they may need them, and many a good turn they may do them. They that are the greateſt among Men, and ſit at the upper end of the World, may need the help of the Faith, and Prayers of the meaneſt Saints, they may need them to interpoſe with God for them, and ward off his blows, or remove his plagues; and when he hath no reſpect to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their own ſakes, yet he may for the ſake of his Servants among them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is folly in any People to Perſecute them that are truly Religious.</hi> That is but to fall foul upon their Friends, and then they lie open to their Enemies, or are indeed their own greateſt Enemies: to pluck the Stakes out of the Hedge, and turn the Vineyard into a Common: to pull up the Sluces, and then there is nothing to keep out an Inundation of evils; to pull down the Pillars, and then the Houſe comes tumbling about their Ears: It is indeed but to dig their own Graves, to make way for their own deſtruction, by deſtroying thoſe that are their preſervers. For by this means they loſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The benefit of the Saints Prayers.</hi> When Men go on maliciouſly to abuſe, and oppreſs the godly among them, God may refuſe to hear even their Prayers for them. The Jews perſecuted <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſlandered
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:42587:392" rendition="simple:additions"/> him as a Traytor, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.13. <hi>ſmote him with</hi> their <hi>tongues, deviſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices againſt him,</hi> &amp; 11, 19. put him in the Dungeon, and God would not hear his Prayers for them. Their poſterity perſecuted the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and though his Prayers were heard, for many of them converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and afterward by the Preaching of the Apoſtles; yet when they ſtill perſevered in their perſecuting thoſe very Apoſtles, their Prayers could not prevail for them, but God gave them up firſt to hardneſs of heart, and blindneſs of mind, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. and then to their Enemies Sword. Or, God may ſtop the mouths of his Saints that they ſhall not ſo much as pray for them, he may (as was before intimated) ſtraiten them, and withdraw from them. When they begin to open their lips for thoſe whom he hath appointed for deſtruction. Nay, he may ſet their Hearts to pray againſt them, and thereby haſten his judgments on them. It is true, Gods Children are commanded to pray for their Enemies, and Perſecutors, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. and there may be Mercy in ſtore with God for them, when what they do, they do as <hi>Paul</hi> did before his converſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>ignorantly in unbeleif:</hi> Thus <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Prayed for thoſe that ſtoned him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.6. <hi>Lord lay not this Sin to their charge,</hi> and Chriſt for thoſe that Crucified him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> And yet Chriſt himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the World out of his Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the World,</hi> i. e. not for the reprobate World, or the World in oppoſition to thoſe his <hi>Father had given him.</hi> How often doth <hi>David</hi> pray againſt his Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors eſpecially, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. &amp; 109. though his Prayers are generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, yet Prayers ſtill they are, and how often do we find, him and other Saints, Praying againſt Idolaters, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>haters of</hi> Zion, 129.5. obſtinate and hardened Enemies of Gods Truth, and Ways, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. &amp; 94. And though the Jews in <hi>Babylon</hi> were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pray for the Peace of the City, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. yet that muſt be but a limited command, they were to pray for the Peace of <hi>Babylon</hi> during its time, and ſo long as it was to be the place of their abode, but they were not to pray for its perpetual Peace and Welfare, for that had been to pray againſt the declared mind of God in all thoſe Propheſies which foretold its ruin, and indeed againſt their own deliverance, which was to follow upon the beginning of <hi>Babylons</hi> deſtruction, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of that Empire. Nay, do we not find them praying for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on it? <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.35. <hi>The violence done to me and my Fleſh, be upon</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon <hi>ſhall</hi> Zion <hi>ſay, and my Blood upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Chaldea <hi>ſhall</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſay.</hi> Gods Children ought to pray for their own private Enemies; nay, for thoſe that at preſent are Enemies to the publick Weal of <hi>Zion,</hi> as not knowing who of them may come to be her Friends; (God may have a Seed among them;) all have not <hi>ſinned the ſin unto death,</hi> though many may, for whom they are expreſly forbid to pray, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. and if they knew in particular who they were, they ought no more to pray for them, than for the Devil himſelf, (if <hi>Auſtin</hi> may be beleived) But certain it is they muſt not, cannot, dare not,
<pb n="992" facs="tcp:42587:393" rendition="simple:additions"/> pray for the implacable, incorrigible Enemies of their Lord and Maſter. Nay, they cannot pray for the exaltation of Chriſts Kingdom, but they at the ſame time pray for the downfal of ſuch, whenever they pray <hi>Gods Will may be done, and his Kingdom come.</hi> They pray for the confuſion of thoſe that obſtinately oppoſe his Will, and whoſe ruin muſt make way for the coming of his Kingdom, and ſo all the Saints in the World are every Day Praying againſt the Malignant, hardned Enemies, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of Chriſt and his People. And is it not a Dreadful thing to have the Prayers of Saints, of Thouſands of Saints, of all the Saints upon Earth againſt them? Thoſe Prayers which ſhall not be loſt, which will be heard, and not one of them be in vain. See, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. what power the Prayers of the Saints have, Gods Witneſſes even in their Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5, 6. what is the <hi>Fire that proceeds out of their Mouths,</hi> but the Judgments they Denounce, and by Prayer bring down upon the Anti-Chriſtian World? No Army with Banners, more Terrible, than a Company of Praying Saints. When Saints are full of Prayer, Heaven is big with Vengeance; and their Prayers cannot go up ſo faſt, but Judgments will ſoon come down as faſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They loſe the help of the Saints, God,</hi> his Protection, and whatever Favour he hath been wont to ſhew them, for the ſake of his Saints. This follows upon the former, and I ſhall meet with it again under the next uſe. To conclude this therefore, The Enemies would fain, now as well as in former Ages, extirpate Gods Seed from out of the Earth, their Language is, as the <hi>Jews</hi> was of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.22. <hi>It is not fit that they ſhould Live:</hi> They would have <hi>the Name of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be no more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> Pſal. 83.4. But what would they get by that! were the Holy Seed, the Plants of Gods Planting ſtub'd up, how ſoon would the Vineyard be laid waſt? If the Green Trees were out of the way, the Fire of Gods Wrath would quickly conſume the Drie: and what ſhould hinder? Who ſhould Interpoſe with the Lord of the Vineyard?

Human Strength, and Human Wiſdom, may be able to do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; the Power and Policy of Enemies may be too hard for the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Strength of the Godly; but when you can do leaſt your ſelves, you may Engage God, by Prayer, to do moſt. <hi>He is Wiſe in Heart, and Mighty in Strength,</hi> Job 9.4. If he take your part, he can turn about the Hearts of Enemies, diſappoint their Devices, befool their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, or, if need be, break their Power. Enemies are commonly the Inſtruments of Evil brought upon a Land, yet they are but Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God himſelf is the principal Agent, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. they are the Rods in his Hand, the Scourges, which he uſeth, or lays aſide when he pleaſeth. You may be helpful in diverting the Evils which Enemies might do, though you touch not themſelves, but Addreſs to God, and ſet him againſt them. You may do in this Caſe, as when you have to do with Men in Civil things; if a Prince be offended with you, and like to puniſh you, though what he doth, he doth by Miniſters, and Officers, yet you do not fall a quarrelling with them, but apply your ſelf to the Prince, if he be pacified toward you, his Officers dare not meddle with you, his Pardon is a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to all their <hi>Actions.</hi> Try what you can do with God, if he ſide with you, either Men ſhall not deſire to touch you, or not be able, if they would, to hurt you. Think how many times have the Prayers of the Saints prevailed with God in the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayers prevailed to deliver <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſo cloſely purſued them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Why Cryeſt thou unto me?</hi> and at other times, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>Aſa</hi>'s Prayer prevailed againſt <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and his <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Army, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11, 12. and <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> againſt the <hi>Amonites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. And if Prayer hath been ſo prevalent, why may it not be ſo ſtill? It is an old tried means, which hath not uſed to fail; do not ſay, Theſe were more Eminent Saints, and ſo could do more with God by Prayer, than you can; but remember, you have the ſame God to Pray to, that they had, and he delights as much in Prayer now, as then he did, and can do as much for us, as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And how, loud do ſo many Sins Cry in Gods Ears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You had need Pray hard for Mercy, when Sin Crys ſo loud for Vengeance.

So much Sin as you hinder, ſo much you contribute to the Peace and Proſperity of the Nation. It is vain to think of preventing Judgment, if you do not endeavour to hinder Sin, which calls for it: though Puniſhment may not immediately follow at the heels of Sin, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnce againſt an Evil Work may not be ſpeedily Executed,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. yet ſo long as Sin is ſpared, or connived at, it is all the while breeding Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the ſtore of Sin adds to the Treaſure of Wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Do all the Good you can,</hi> 'tis your ſeveral places, not only your Perſonal, but Relative Capacities, by Inſtruction, by Counſel, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, labour to propagate Goodneſs to all, with whom you converſe; while others are ſpreading Sin, do you endeavour to promote Holineſs. Commend the Ways of God to others, by walking exactly in them your ſelves. Practice thoſe things that are <hi>Lovely, Philip.</hi> 4.8. That may be a means to make thoſe love your Religion, who hitherto never lov'd your ſelves. The more you do for the gaining of Souls, the more you do for the good of the Nation: every Saint you are Inſtrumental to make, will be a new Stake in the Hedg, a new Stone in the Wall, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Strength and Security of the Land.</p>

If the truly Religious be a Defence to the Nation, do you accordingly carry your ſelves toward them; uſe them well, make much of them, be kind to them, take heed of hurting them: Be ſo far Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient for once, to your Father the Devil, as not Gratifie him to your own Undoing, by Maligning, Traducing, Oppoſing or Perſecuting, thoſe that fain would Save you, and, under God, are your beſt Benefactors; do not hinder them from being Godly, from Serving their Lord, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whereby they are preventing your Ruin, and promoting your Good.

I know you will be ready to ſay, they are not Saints, but a company of Factious, or Seditious, or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Perſons, whom you oppoſe. I wonder what is become of all the Saints, you dare not ſay you are ſuch your ſelves, and all that are not like you in Sin, though never ſo much of the ſame Judgment with you, you call Hypocrites. Hath God no true Servants left in the Land? or where muſt we look for them? But what if the Dirt you throw upon the Factious, be found ſticking upon the Religious? What if the Wound you give the the Hypocrites, draw Blood from the Saints? and thoſe that you call the Enemies of the Nation, appear to be the Friends of God? It coſt <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> dear, for Killing thoſe <hi>that reſembled the Children of a King,</hi> Judg. 8.18. Take heed of daring to put forth your Hands againſt thoſe that do but reſemble the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, leaſt, when you think not of it, they prove to have been ſo.

He that is a Kings Son may be but a Child, and ſo but feeble himſelf, and not able to reſiſt the force of One that is ſtrong, and violent, but he hath a King for his Father, One that hath a Sovereign Power, and can Command Thouſands, and by him he may prevail over a ſtrong Enemy. The Godly may be but weak, and mean, and contemptible, in themſelves, but they have a Friend, nay, a Father that is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſts is their Redeemer, One that can deal with you, over-top you, cruſh you, make you periſh with the very <hi>Rebukes of his Countenance,</hi> Pſal. 80.16.

They ſuffer ſo many unworthy things, however upon other pretences, yet really becauſe they belong to him; ſo that if you ſtrike at them, you

Chriſt at the laſt Day will Judg you according as your Carriage hath been to his People, and Interprets all done, or not done, to them, as done, or not done, to himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. God may for a long time keep ſilence, and let you alone; but one Day will meet with you; be ſure in the other Life, it may be in this: and then, can you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ward off his Blows,</hi> when he lays them on you? Can you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Power, grapple with Omnipotence? Cannot he bring thoſe Evils upon you, which it is impoſſible for you to keep off, or reſiſt? <hi>The Lord will come with Fire, and his Chariots like a Whirlwind, to render his Anger with Fury, and his Rebukes with Flames of Fire,</hi> Iſa. 66.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or, <hi>Can you bear what he Inflicts? Can your Hearts endure, can your Hands be ſtrong,</hi> when <hi>he</hi> comes to <hi>deal with you?</hi> Ezek. 22.14.

A fit of the Stone, or Cholick, makes you almoſt Mad, and how then will you endure, if God himſelf once take you to hand, if he fill you with his Fury, and pour out his Wrath immediately upon your Souls?</p>
            <p>Is it not then your Intereſt to favour Gods Saints, to take heed of medling with them to their hurt, when it is like, the concluſion, to be in your own? when as they are your beſt Friends. So they may prove your moſt Formidable Enemies, by Engaging God againſt you, who, when they ſuffer wrongfully, will not fail to take their part, and be on their ſide, and though he uſe you for a time, as Scourges in his Hand for the Correction of them, yet when he hath done with you, is then ready to throw you into the Fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.12. Remember then, that as the Religious of a Nation ordinarily do moſt good to them; ſo when they are abuſed, and trampled upon, they do moſt hurt, becauſe God pleads their Cauſe, and eſpouſes their Quarrel; many a Judgment they bring down upon their Enemies, that is, God doth for them: the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to them, is ſeverely puniſhed upon them that do it.

            <p>OMnipotent and Eternal goodneſs never wants Inſtruments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Church from ſlavery, or reform it from degeneracy. All the Empires and Emperors in the World, have ſerved the Kingdom of God, and been as Scaffolds ſet up about the Houſe of God, to be taken down when that is built up and finiſhed. They have been as <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and <hi>Nethamins</hi> to the Temple of the Lord. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was Gods Rod upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> Back. <hi>Perſian</hi> was here Gods Shepherd, whoſe Spirit was ſtirred up to raiſe up the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Servant, and the <hi>Romans</hi> have been but Gods ſlaves to do his Will againſt their own.</p>
            <p>The State of the Church at this juncture, was the end of a deſolation, or beginning of a reformation. The Jews had weathered out Seventy Years in Captivity, wherein multitudes of them were wore off, a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being left, God raiſed up <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and moved him to ſet them free from <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to the Propheſie of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1. Two Hundred and Ten Years before.</p>
            <p>Many of the People through lazy worldlineſs or deſpondency, choſe rather ſtill to lie among the Pots in <hi>Caldea,</hi> than return to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to build their City and Temple, though <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave them not only liberty by Proclamations, but Accommodations for the Work. But God raiſed up the Spirit of <hi>Zerobabel, Joſhuah, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> to carry it on.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Ezra</hi> was a great Man of God, one of the great Synagogue, a Prophet, a Scribe, a Prieſt. Some will have it, that as <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> cut
<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:42587:397" rendition="simple:additions"/> and burnt the roll, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.23. So the <hi>Caldeans</hi> burned all the Books of the Law, and ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> reſtored them as a Prophet by Revelation or his Memory, but this is falſe, for <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.2. underſtood by Books, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the Seventy Years, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf read the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> for <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.2. he ſays, the Lord charged him to build his Houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But he was a Prophet, as he was directed by Gods Spirit to compoſe this Hiſtory of his, and a perfect Scribe living to <hi>Malachi</hi>'s time, he wrote the complete Old Teſtament, and made a perfect Copy. But here he Officiates as a Prieſt, the Son of <hi>Seraiah, Ezra</hi> 7.1. from <hi>Phineas, Eleazar,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to ſerve the Lord. When they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temple nor Tabernacle; they ſet up the worſhip of the God of Heaven in theopen Heaven, which was neither Typical nor Topical, but Natural and Evangelical Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Upon the Firſt Day of the Seventh Month, in a Pulpit, in the Street, (the People meeting as one Man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.1.) he read the Law of God, and that diſtinctly, giving the Sence of it, verſe 8. from Morning to Noon, and all the Congregation ſtood attentively, and at Noon proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he Diſmiſſed them with a Bleſſing according, to <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23.

               </gap> let it be ſo, Bleſſed be God by us, and Bleſſed be we of the Lord, or as <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.6. It is expounded, <hi>Amen;</hi> the Lord do ſo, the Lord perform the words which thou haſt ſpoken. This <hi>Amen</hi> was uſed to be ſet to when good was ſpoken, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.36. when <hi>David</hi> commanded <hi>Solomon</hi> to be made King, <hi>Benaiah</hi> ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> the Lord do ſo. Or when in Imprecations of evil, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.22. the Woman tried by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jealouſie, which ſprinkled on the Curſe, it blotted out the Curſe if ſhe was Innocent, if Guilty, her Thigh preſently rotted, ſhe was to ſay <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> let it be ſo if I be Guilty, and let it be ſo if I be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. So at the end of the Curſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.10. and all the People ſhall ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> they are loath to have the Curſe come, therefore they are commanded there to ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> but they need no command to Seal the Bleſſings with <hi>Amen,</hi> all are apt enough to Beleive and Wiſh them.</p>
            <p>But here is a double <hi>Amen,</hi> which hath the greater Emphaſis, and requires greater Attention and Intention of mind, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.5. Bleſs the Lord your God, for ever and ever, and Bleſſed be his Glorious Name; which is exalted above all Bleſſings and Praiſe; Ever and Ever, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> or let it be ratified in Heaven, ſo on Earth. And the Jews ſay, that he that pronounceth this <hi>Amen,</hi> as he ought, is greater than he that Bleſſeth in the Name of the Lord; he that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth this <hi>Amen</hi> with all his might, the Gates of Heaven flie open to him. But there are Three evil <hi>Amens;</hi> they call the 1. Abbreviated in the firſt Sillable or Letter, and whoever ſo pronounceth it, as to haſten his <hi>Amen,</hi> his Days ſhall be ſoon paſſed. 2. There is <hi>Amen</hi> cut off in the laſt Sillable ſuppreſſed. 3. There is the Pupillar or Orphan <hi>Amen,</hi> when it is pronounced at random, impertinently and unſeaſonably, without Underſtanding, Prayer, or Praiſe foregoing, and ſo there is no Father to beget Devotion in them, and ſo 'tis an Orphan <hi>Amen,</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be Fatherleſs that pronounceth ſuch a lifeleſs Word, and a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs <hi>Amen.</hi> But he that with knowledg and fervour pronounceth this <hi>Amen,</hi> his Days ſhall be prolonged upon Earth, as <hi>Buxtorff</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now I am to give you ſome conſiderations and arguments for the uſe of this <hi>Amen,</hi> and the manner of it, and they are Seven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is lawful and laudable publickly to uſe it, becauſe it is connatural to Prayer and Praiſe. I do not lay the lawfulneſs of it upon a <hi>Perſian</hi> decree, or a poſitive Injunction, ſet on things no ways connatural to the Action; for that is forced Meat, and turns a Mans Stomack, and his Conſcience. There is no need for a Rubrick by the Men of the great Synagogue, or a Canon to command a Man to bluſh, when it is only the natural paſſion that will command it. So when the heart is warm in Prayer with ſerious and earneſt affections, a double <hi>Amen,</hi> doth as naturally flow from us, as Milk from a Mothers Breaſt to her Suckling, and <hi>Amen</hi> comes from <hi>Amen,</hi> which ſignifies to Nurſe, as if it were, if
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:42587:398" rendition="simple:additions"/> not the Mother, yet the faithful Nurſe of lively Devotion. Aſſent to Repetitions is eſſential unto Prayer, and it is not ſignified publickly, but by our <hi>Amen.</hi> Not that we are obliged to ſpeak it always, and with a loud Voice, <hi>quantis arteriis opus eſt ſi pro ſono audiamur Tert.</hi> what Lungs had we need to have if God hear us for our loudneſs? But when the heart is affected, we ſee here how the People ſtood up, and lift up their hands to Heaven, naturally ſignifying they would lift the Name of God with all their might; but they caſt down themſelves, bowing down their Heads, and worſhipping the Lord with their Faces to the ground; who can hold his Breath from a groan or ſigh, when matter and affection meet together? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> here could not withhold their hands, nor <hi>Hannah</hi> hold ſtill her Eyes when earneſt in Temple Prayer, nor can a zealous heart hold the Tongue from moving to an <hi>Amen,</hi> at the end of Prayer and Praiſe. There is no Child of God that can ſay our Father, but lower or louder, he muſt and will ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> The Jews in time of Incenſe called themſelves mutes in deep ſilent Prayer, when they praiſed God on Inſtruments, Semivocates, but when in open Prayer and Praiſes, then they were Vocates in their <hi>Amens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the practiſe of the Old and New Teſtament Beleivers for our example. In <hi>Moſes</hi> you had it in <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> oft uſeth it in the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> yea, this double <hi>Amen, Pſal.</hi> 41.13. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting, Amen and Amen.</hi> God was <hi>Iſraels</hi> God, accepting their Praiſes, hearing Prayers, fulfilling promiſes, and this for Ever and Ever, and be it Eternally rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> to all Generations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.48. the ſame words are repeated with this exhortation, let all the People ſay <hi>Amen, Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah.</hi> And they had the ſame Praiſes and Petitions to offer, therefore the ſame concluſion is ſuitable. So the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaking of Gods Oath, to give <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Jews, ſays, Oh Lord <hi>Amen,</hi> or be it ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.5. ſo <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. how can the Idiot, the private Man, who knows only his own private ſingle Language, ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to Prayer or Praiſe in another Tongue; which not only imports the cuſtom, but the manner of ſaying <hi>Amcn,</hi> to be with Faith and Underſtanding, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.21. <hi>to him be Glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus throughout all Ages, World without end Amen.</hi> Yea, Jeſus Chriſt, a greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> Prophets and Apoſtles, adds this concluſion to his perfect form of Petitions, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. ſo in his Book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> chap. 5, 14. <hi>the Four Beaſts, and Four and Twenty Elders, who repreſented tho whole Church of Jews and Gentiles together, cry Amen.</hi> Yea, that innumerable Company of thoſe Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, who had white Robes and Palms in their Hands, as Victors over Temptations, with the Elders and Angels, fell on their Faces, and worſhipped God, ſaying, <hi>Amen.</hi> Bleſſing, and Glory, and Honour, and Wiſdom, and Thankſgiving, and Power, and Might, be unto our God for Ever and Ever <hi>Amen, Rev.</hi> 7.12. So at the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the Voice of many Thunders and Waters, the Church cries <hi>Amen Hallelujah.</hi> The Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth, and hath Avenged the Blood of
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:42587:398" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Servants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.4. Yea, it laſts unto the mariage of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. ſtill when the Bridegroom comes, the Church cries <hi>Amen,</hi> come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Amen,</hi> after Prayer and Praiſe, is the Mans conſent, judgment, and approbation of what is offered unto God, it is the ſetting to of our Seal to all, and our putting our Hands to bear a part in the Praiſes, and to have a ſhare in the Petitions. It imports the deſire of our Soul, which is, the formality of Prayer; now all theſe are eſſential to theſe Duties, and the pronunciation, is but the publication of our reward, Senſe which is very ſignificant in publick Worſhip, Hearing is but the formal Senſe in conceiving the Petitions, but Speech brings them forth, and is a more open profeſſion, and a more Maſculine expreſſion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.41. <hi>let us lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the Heavens.</hi> When the heart is intenſly elevated to God, it carries the Hands and the Voice along with it, it Acts all the Body from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> Phraſeth it, <hi>bona conſcientia eructat ad ſuperficiem,</hi> he lifts up his Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.8. and Body too to God, as they lifted up the Mincah, or Heav-Offering, and waved it before the Lord; the Soul will work the body into Simpathy, when it is earneſt indeed, that which made the Veins of the Body to open their Mouths in drops of Blood, as Chriſt his Prayer in his Agony did, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. will certainly make us open our Lips. Out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth ſpeaks, <hi>Luke.</hi> 6.46.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Vocal <hi>Amen,</hi> is as it were the Epitome and ſumm of all our Petitions and Praiſes to God, 'tis the Center which all thoſe Lines are drawn towards. It is all the Duty vertually reduced to one word and point. Yea, it is the repeating and ecchoing, or redoubling of all over again. As the Mercury behind the Glaſs, it reverterates the lively Image of all preceding Devotion. It is a drawing the Arrow to the Pile by a ſtrong ejaculation, <hi>qua toto corde deum petimus, in Bellarmines Phraſe;</hi> whereby the whole heart is darted up to God. It is a ſtirring up our ſelves to take hold of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. <hi>It is taking aim, and directing our Prayer to him, and looking up;</hi> Pſal. 5.3. as if they would hand up Gods Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him, and ſtand ready to receive his Mercies with open Hands and Mouths. It winds up all together in one bundle; many are willing to have God forgive their treſpaſſes, but cannot ſo readily forgive others, we may be free for God to give us daily Bounty and Bread, but cannot make it as Meat and Drink to do his Will. Men will eaſily accept of Gods kindneſs; not ſo roundly pay their tribute of Praiſes. Such cannot roundly Pray, nor ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Ah Lord, and <hi>Amen,</hi> are two long Prayers in few words, managed by the whole Soul, and thus it is an <hi>Amen</hi> with an <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> when we ſeek God with all our hearts, then we find him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> rightly pronounced is an intenſe Act of Faith, or it involves a ſtrong Faith. The Hebrew Verb in <hi>Niphat,</hi> ſignifies to be firm, ſtable, and ſtrong, and in <hi>Hiphil,</hi> it ſignifies, to beleive and truſt, and indeed, we cannot beleive or truſt to any thing but that which is ſtable, invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and immutable. So that there are two Declarations made by this
<pb n="1004" facs="tcp:42587:399" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Amen.</hi> 1. That God is firm and immutably true in himſelf and his word. 2. That we will not only beleive his Truth, but truſt to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and build upon it; as the Prophet doth both, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.5. this is a laying hold on Gods Strength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5. as we ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.6. he beleived God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Vehermen,</hi> Gods Truth is beleived, his veracity truſted to. <hi>Iſrael</hi> twiſted about both theſe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he wreſtled with God and prevailed. The Jews ſay, <hi>Amen habet tres nucleos,</hi> hath Three Kernels, the one is of an Oath, the Second of Faith, the Third of Confidence, as <hi>Bunto</hi> ſays, on <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> When we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed our Sins, we do by our <hi>Amen</hi> ſay, all is true, and we have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Gods diſpleaſure, we beg pardon of them, and ſo beleive God hath promiſed Pardon to the Penitent, we truſt our ſelves with God in Chriſt, and beleive that he will Pardon our Sins, as all others that caſt themſelves upon his promiſed Grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The unanimous pronunciation of <hi>Amen,</hi> is an aſſurance, that God will accept our Praiſes, and anſwer our Prayers; So as the Soul comes off with <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Vicimus,</hi> we have prevailed, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.24. <hi>what things ſoever ye deſire when you Pray, beleive that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them;</hi> nay, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.15. <hi>If we know that he heareth us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ask, we know that we have the Petitions we deſired of him.</hi> We ought to beleive we ſhall have them, either in kind or value, and infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, muſt be Judge in that Caſe alone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.19. <hi>if two of you agree on Earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> If any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Soul Pray in Faith, it ſhall be heard, much more, if two have a Symphony, as the word imports, they ſhall be anſwered; how much more, when the whole Congregation is in Harmony, and unanimouſly cries, <hi>Amen,</hi> when the whole Congregation meets as one Man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.1. and the multitude of Beleivers are of one Heart and Soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. God will ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch <hi>Amens.</hi> They are as it were a <hi>bath col,</hi> the Eccho and Voice of God from the Mercy-Seat. <hi>Sanctorum vota ſunt oracula,</hi> Gods Spirit ſtirs up ſuch Prayers, and they ſhall not be denied.</p>
            <p>The Soul, like <hi>Luther,</hi> ſays, <hi>fiat voluntas mea,</hi> as Men make their Wills in the Name of God, <hi>Amen;</hi> it ſhall be thus, for once let my Will Oh Lord be done. Heavens Gate is open to this united Knock.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, This unanimous <hi>Amen</hi> of Faith, ſtrikes terror on the Enemies of the Church, whether Devils or Men. When the <hi>Romans</hi> had Conquered <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Flaminius</hi> cauſed Peace to be proclaimed to the <hi>Grecians;</hi> there was ſuch a Shout, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the very Crows and other Birds, fell down to the ground, the Air was ſo rent and ſhaken. And when the Church of God, Terrible as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with Banners, gives her unanimous Voices of <hi>Amens;</hi> not only Satan falls like lightning from Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. but <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> by <hi>Peters</hi> Prayer, is fetch'd down, when he attempted to flie in the Air, as if he had been the Holy Dove, and Power of God; as Eccleſiaſtical Story relates. And <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, that upon <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his Prayers, and his Armies, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Captain, was ſmitten with a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt,
<pb n="1005" facs="tcp:42587:399" rendition="simple:additions"/> and his Soldiers by Fire. As the Turks Mined the Eaſtern Empire of the <hi>Romans</hi> by Fire, Smoke and Brimſton, <hi>i, e.</hi> by Guns and Gun-powder, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.17. when the Church is united in hearty <hi>Amens, it is like the Shout that the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>gave when God and his Ark came into the Camp, which was ſuch a great ſound that the Earth rang.</hi> 1 Sam. 4.5. <hi>for then God is gone up with a Shout,</hi> Pſal. 47.5. to anſwer the Prayers made for the Salvation of his People. This makes the hearts of their Enemies to melt and tremble as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did. As <hi>Hierom</hi> expreſſeth it, the hollow Idols and their Temples, that were empty, did Eccho and Rebound the Churches <hi>Amens;</hi> ſo as their Fabricks ſhaked. Thus when the <hi>(Shophar)</hi> lovely Trumpet ſounded the Seventh time upon the Seventh day, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.20. the Walls of <hi>Jerico fell,</hi> and ſo ſhall the Gates and Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Preaching of the Goſpel on the Lords Days, and the Prayers of the Saints. The united Breath of Gods People, ſends a blaſt upon their Enemies, the Trumpet blew, and the People ſhouted, and <hi>Jerico</hi> fell down to the ground. Our <hi>Amens,</hi> muſt not drop like a cold Bullet of Lead, out of the mouth of a Muſquet, bowing to the ground, but they muſt be Fired by preparations of the Heart, and warm affections, they muſt be Diſcharged and Shot off with the utmoſt valde of the Soul, and fervency of the Spirit: <hi>Samuel</hi> Thundred in Prayer, and God Thundred upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> Enemies. So <hi>David</hi> Prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.5. <hi>that God would bow the Heavens and come down,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; Pſ. 1.8, 9. <hi>he did bow the Heavens and come down,</hi> &amp; verſe 13. <hi>the Lord Thundred in Heaven, the higheſt gave his Voice, Hailſtones, and coals of Fire.</hi> When Gods People can unite in one Voice, God gives his Voice with them, and for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> The Firſt Inference then, is of Reproof for our deep ſilence, and too much neglect of this hearty <hi>Amen,</hi> which proceeds from theſe Four ill Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From thence, whence all ill things come in upon us, even from Popiſh ignorance and darkneſs. When Men grew dull and ſtupid, and neither underſtood, or cared to underſtand, either the word of God to us, or ours to him in Prayer. Religion was looked upon as a (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) a By-buſineſs, or troubleſome, laborious, and needleſs curioſity. It was enough to Beleive as the Church Beleived, and to Pray as the Church Prayed, and ſo they devolved all their Devotions, on a pack of idle Monks and Friers, whom they called Religious Omers, who ſhould ſerve God ſupererogate, and merit for them; yea, not only procure a freedom from Purgatory and Pardons, but Paradice alſo for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys. And as ſoon as their Silver did chink in the Baſon of the Prieſt, out ſprings the Soul from Purgatory; as if the ſound of Money was powerful in Purgatory, as true <hi>Amens</hi> are in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Diviſions among Chriſtians of the reformed Religion, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe of this defect and neglect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>when ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one hath a Pſalm, a Doctrine, a Tongue, a Revelation, an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</hi> One was for Singing, another for Reading, a Third for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one for Propheſying, another for Interpreting, the Apoſtle gives two Rules to oppoſe this and Womens talking in the Church, let all
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:42587:400" rendition="simple:additions"/> things be done diſtinctly, and in order to edification, natural decency forbids all confuſion. In our days, ſome have ſuch Schiſmatical Phraſes, Notions, and Doctrines in Preaching, Praying, and Praiſing, that a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſtian cannot ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> Some ſo zealous for Forms, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe muſt be a Prayer but the Lords Prayer; as if becauſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls it a Legitimate Form, all others were ſpurious, when 'tis the Senſe that is the Prayer; and not the words which are differently ſet down in <hi>Luke</hi> from <hi>Mathew,</hi> as <hi>Chemitius</hi> well obſerves. Others are ſo vehement againſt all Forms, that they would reduce all Devotion to an inviſible Spirituality, as if they had drop'd their Bodies, and were crouded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vail, into the Triumphant Quire of Spirits in Heaven. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly while we are in the Body, we ought to glorifie God with our Bodies as well as our Spirits, and with our Tongues as the Bodies Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in publick Worſhip. <hi>Verbo deus laudandus quia deus verbum,</hi> ſays <hi>Lactan:</hi> God was made Fleſh to ſpeak to us, therefore we ought to ſpeak to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9. the Tongue is Mans Glory as it differenceth us from Beaſts, ſo it make us Prieſts to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. to offer up our own, and the dumb Creatures Sacrifices of Praiſe to God, <hi>to him be Glory and Dominion for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another rate of this defect, is the degenerating of Aſſemblies from their firſt Conſtitution and Plantation. For theſe, as all Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted defilements both in Miniſters and People. Formality hath over-run that Zeal, Piety and Charity, which formerly burned among them. So that many Aſſemblies are run down ſo into the Spirit of the World, that they differ little from Papiſts. How have ſome Miniſters been thruſt in upon the Aſſemblies by a ſecular hand, who never underſtood how to preach or pray a live Prayer, and many Congregations full of ſuch ignorance and prophaneſs, that the Arches and Vaults in the Building, give as good an Eccho as their dead <hi>Amens.</hi> One comes in his Drink, another pipeing hot out of their Wordly Buſineſſes, a Third in huffing Finery and Bravery, to be gazed on; another is heavy laden with Sleep, and comes for a Nap. How can they that are not concerned for Gods Glory, his Church, his Word, the pardon of their Sins, nor think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beholden to God for Daily-Bread, or that they need daily Grace, ſay either Our Father or <hi>Amen,</hi> with any Senſe. When either Miniſters or People, Drink, and Swill, and Swear, and roar with one another at the Tavern all the Week, and yet will be the moſt Vocal and Loud in their reſponſals on the Lords Day, it turns Mens Stomacks and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from publick expreſſions, as ſomething to rankly of Hypocritical Formality. That, with the wiſe Heathen in the Ship, when a Company of wicked Perſons cried and prayed, hold your peace ſad he, leaſt the Gods know you are here, and ſo deſtroy us. <hi>D. Laer.</hi> Roaring at the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and bellowing at the Church, are both alike beaſtly and ugly to be heard.</p>

<pb n="1007" facs="tcp:42587:400" rendition="simple:additions"/> God his Rent worſt. When Chriſtians were kept warm by the Zeal of their Perſecutors, they met in Caves and Woods, with the hazard of their Lives; they had a Zeal for God and the Goſpel, they heard and Prayed as for their lives, and for the life of Religion it might be their laſt Sermon or Prayer they might joyn in, and ſo they had a fervent hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty love for one another, which made them not only ſeal their Prayers with warm <hi>Amens,</hi> but they ſealed one another alſo with an holy kiſs, not knowing whether they ſhould ever ſee one anothers Faces again in the Fleſh or no, they fell on one anothers Necks, and kiſſed at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.16. another expreſſion ſpringing naturally from ſtrong affection, truly Chriſtian, in thoſe times, which if practiſed in this dirty Age, would be perhaps proved as well as judged, a piece of wretched carnality. But their Fleſh was kept under by poverty and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo as ſuch filthy tentations were burnt up by the love of God, and each other. And we have cauſe to fear, God hath ſome ſuch Irons in the Fire to fear of that dead, yet proud Fleſh, which in theſe days is bred in the hearts of many profeſſors. In the mean time this Fleſh hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our very lips from cloſing in a ſound <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. This then informs us, that if ever the Church recover pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity and fervency, it muſt have ſuch adminiſtrations, as 1. The whole Worſhip of God, muſt be in a known Tongue, that ſo all may ſay <hi>Amen</hi> in the Congregation. It is obſerved by <hi>Tertul. de Paenit.</hi> that Sack is the ſame in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; to which we may add, Engliſh alſo, to ſhew all Nations are Sinners, and need Repentance, and Humiliation in Sack-cloth and Aſhes, and ſo <hi>Amen</hi> is the ſame in all Languages, that all Nations might have the ſame Intelligible Language, in their Devotions eſpecially. But the Papiſts will tell us that a Jewel is of equal value in an ignorant Clowns hand, as it is off when in a Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lapidaries, a Petition to a Prince, is of the ſame efficacy in ones hand, who can neither write nor read, as it is in a Scholars hand, and all is true, if God did not read hearts, when Princes only read papers; God required to be worſhipped with an underſtanding Soul; nay, the Jeſuits tell us the unlearned do merit and obtain more, than they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe they have more humility and fervor: But it is a ſtrange humility and fervency to paſs for a Grace, which is not an Act of an intelligent Man, 'tis ſo far from Divine and Meritorious, that it is not an humane Act. <hi>Cajetan,</hi> more to the plain truth, tells us, that Organs which are a diſtraction to the intelligent Worſhippers, were yet retained to promote the unlearned Mens Devotions; and Charms though not underſtood, yet have power over Serpents and Devils, ſo that Prayers and Praiſes in an unknown Language are with them, Enchantments upon the only wiſe God, and their Devotion is rather the breath of an Organ, than the breathings, and being filled with the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This informs us alſo, that all publick adminiſtrations are to be in the matter of them intelligible, as well as in the form of Language. Miniſters are not to uſe overſtudied Phraſes, and ſingular Notions of their own Fancies, which ſometimes Men endeavour to pin upon their
<pb n="1008" facs="tcp:42587:401" rendition="simple:additions"/> Auditors; Prayer is putting the word and promiſes of God in ſuit, and therefore plain Scriptural Pleadings are our beſt Arguments. Any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible or doubtful expreſſions, do but lay a Stumbling-block in the way, to hinder the hearers giving readily their <hi>Amen.</hi> Therefore we muſt not only Pray with our own Spirits, but with the Peoples under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. our Seal muſt be, and can be only ſet to Gods Covenant, his truſt goes before our <hi>Amen.</hi> So God promiſeth to give his People Paſtors after his own heart, which ſhall feed them with knowledge and underſtanding, without which our Sacrifices are but the offering up of Swines Fleſh, or cutting off a Dogs Neck.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the Congregation muſt be unanimous, of one Heart, Sence, and Soul, or elſe they can never meet and center in one <hi>Amen,</hi> but are in ſeparation when they are together. The Apoſtle tells us, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance of Husband and Wife, cauſeth their Prayers to be hindred, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. when Paſſion is up, Devotion is down, or very oppoſite, like the Mountains of Bleſſing and Curſing, or <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Anah</hi> and <hi>Peninnah,</hi> ſcolding under the ſame Roof. But the true <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is a City at unity with it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.3. one Lord, one Baptiſm, one Bread, one Body, one Soul, one Spirit, one Heart, one Faith, and one Requeſt, <hi>viz. Zec.</hi> 14.9. <hi>that the Lord may be King over all the Earth, that the Lord may be one, and his Name one.</hi> Which will be when God ſhall give his People one heart, and one way, that they may fear him for ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>then there ſhall be as many Taches as Loops, and Sockets as Tenons, and all the Tabernacle be one,</hi> Ex. 36.13. as the Jews when they Sacrificed, they compaſſed the Altar round, ſo when they feaſted they ſate round, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. this Symphony and Harmony, when it obtains, will make one <hi>Amen,</hi> when Gods Praiſes and the Saints Prayers ſhall be all one, which will be when Chriſts Prayer ſhall be anſwered, <hi>John</hi> 17.11. <hi>Let them be one, as thou and I am one;</hi> all heart-burnings ſhall ceaſe, when all our Fire ſhall be only upon Gods Altar, and unite in one pyramedal Flame aſpiring and terminating in the pure Love of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To all this, there muſt come in diligent attention, and intention of mind, for elſe they cannot conſent to all and every part; and as a Man who is to ſet his Hand and Seal to an Indenture, will hear all the Conditions, that he may know what he bindes himſelf to, ſo we being to Seal all the Prayers with our lips and heart, <hi>Amen</hi> had need mind what we Seal to. How do many Frisk and Air their thoughts in Vanities, like a wanton Spanel from his Maſters Walk, and come in from this falſe ſent to the Queſt, with full cry, and a dirty <hi>Amen.</hi> This only mocks Gods All-ſeeing Eye, and Hypocritical Colludes with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. And when we conſider how few hold pace with every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. The Fourth Toletan Counſel that made a Canon againſt any uſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> in <hi>Lent,</hi> might have forbidden <hi>Amens</hi> alſo in publick Congregations, conſidering that Jejune attention and intention of mind, which accompanies the Devotions of the generality. But when all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties ſhall be intelligent, unanimous, intent and affectionate, they may
<pb n="1009" facs="tcp:42587:401" rendition="simple:additions"/> ought, and will ſay <hi>Amens,</hi> with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> too, though Lenten-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, forbid both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 3. Is of Caution, to beware of all that which may hinder this powerful <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then beware of all Sin, deliberate Sins dead our Faith and Spirits in Prayer. <hi>Quantum a praeceptis tantum ab auribus dei diſtamus Tertul. de Ora. Dom.</hi> We are always as much at a diſtance from Gods hearing us, as we are from hearing his righteous precepts. If we regard Iniquity in our hearts, God will not ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to our Prayers, nor can we do it in Faith. How can any ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15, 17. <hi>Curſed be he that worſhips Images, or removes his neighbours Landmarks.</hi> For an unholy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay hallowed be thy Name, is to Pray God to Sanctifie himſelf upon him, and he that cannot have Charity to forgive them that treſpaſs againſt him, while he Prays God to forgive his treſpaſſes, he doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively Pray that God would not forgive his Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of too much Buſineſs, for that duſteth us with ſo many thoughts, which not only choke the word, but ſtifle our Prayers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.38. the Apoſtle would have them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. By theſe convulſive motions of diſtracting thoughts, which pull us firſt on one hand, then on the other, the face of the Duty and the Soul is very diſtorted, ill-favoured, of an ill Scheme and Faſhion; all the Beauty of Duty is gone off, nor can the Soul well ſit cloſe to the Lord, and ſteady, but ſits tottering, half on, half off; no ſetled Frame of Spirit can be maintained. Firſt one buſineſs, then another, comes and pulls us off, to ſpeak with us, ſo as we are not at leaſure to ſpeak with God, as <hi>Cypr. Epiſt.</hi> 8. ſays, <hi>it is ſtrange we ſhould think God ſhould hear us, when we do not hear our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware of a lazy poſture of the Body, for the Soul is drawn into conſent and ſympathy with it, verſe 5. here the Jews ſtood up to ſhew their reverence and attention to the word of God. They lifted up their hands, bowed down their heads, and worſhipped the Lord with their faces to the ground, here was exalted Attention and Devotion, and moſt humble veneration, with intenſe affections, and theſe could ſay, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> But to ſee one ſit and hang down his head, and hang his hat on his noſe, or perhaps ſleeping till he ſnore himſelf awake, and then give a yawn or an idle <hi>Amen,</hi> any one without breach of Charity may think him guilty of lazy Hypocriſie with deteſtation. This is a mocking of God, giving the Congregation a flap with this Foxes tail, when they have cunningly ſlept over the greateſt part of the Prayer, and ſlipt out of the Congregation without removeal. <hi>Irreligioſiſſimum eſt ſedere niſi quod deo exprobamus quod oratio nos fatigaverit,</hi> as <hi>Tertul. de Or. do.</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis moſt indecent, (without a good Reaſon) to ſit at Prayer, for 'tis elſe, in effect, to tell God, Prayer hath tired us out.</hi>

We ſhould never offer God that which coſt us nothing; put off thy Shoes from thy Feet, Vain Thoughts, and Vile Affections, and put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, e're you go into the Fathers Preſence! A Worldly Spirit coming off from common Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, is not fit for Communion with God.

We muſt watch unto Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. for the Devil is there, as to catch away the good Seed, ſo to catch us away by every wandring Thought, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were at Chriſts Transfiguration in the Mount, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.32. but were ſadly heavy with Sleep. It is ſtrange, when they ſhould have been taken up with Raptures and Extaſies of Joy, that they ſhould be ſo Droſſie and Drowſie. But how hard a matter it is for to watch with Chriſt One Hour in Duty. Grief might make them heavy in the Garden, and yet Chriſt his Propaſſion, and Sweating Drops of Blood, was enough to have put them into an Agony of Compaſſion. But alas, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Garden, nor the Mount, is able to tranſport us, or keep up Intention of Soul or Affection, unleſs God keep Fire on his own Altar, and blow up our Spark into a Flame.</p>
